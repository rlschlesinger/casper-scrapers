"2774","Licensable Technology","""MoleProbe"": A real-time molecular diagnostic device","Parker, Kevin Kit","MARKETS ADDRESSED:The polymer film will enable surgical instruments to detect cancerous tissues with molecular specificity and sensitivity.  In one application, a catheter will be capable of providing point of care tumor diagnostics by oncologists.  Other clinical applications may leverage the versatile polymer films to regulate analyte concentrations in solution or provide localized delivery of drugs or analytes, while non-clinical applications may generate label-free electrochemical CMOS microarrays and proteomic chips.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:The invention is a novel engineering method for generation of freestanding 2-D and 3-D tissue structures. Biopolymers (proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, nucleic acids or combinations thereof) are deposited onto a transitional polymer surface with a patterning technique that allows for nanometer-to-millimeter-scale spatial positioning. In one example, the transitional polymer layer dissolves or switches states to release the biopolymer structure(s).  The free-standing biopolymer structure(s) is then seeded with functionally active cells that become spatially organized according to the imprinted pattern.  Alternatively, the predetermined pattern of the biopolymer scaffold is seeded with functionally active cells that become spatially organized according to the imprinted pattern. Subsequently, the transitional polymer layer dissolves or switches states to release the biopolymer structure(s) and cells together as an integrated, free-standing construct.  The predetermined pattern upon which the cells attach and the cell type used to seed the film/polymer scaffold depends upon the desired tissue type.  For example, smooth muscle cells are used for blood vessels and other internal organs, striated muscle cell for skeletal muscle tissue, and cardiac (cardiomyocytes) for heart tissue.  Alternatively, the structure is assembled in an iterative manner by which a scaffold is made, seeded with cells, and stacked with another scaffold, which in turn is seeded with cells.  This seed/stack process is repeated to construct a 3-D structure.  In some cases different cell types are seeded together or sequentially, e.g, for construction of neural tissue, glial cells are seeded and then neurons."," Tissue Engineering  |   Biomaterials","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=2774","Mick Sawka, (617) 496-3830","Harvard University"

Squires","Tufts University Categories:research tool:cell lineAdditional Keywords:genetic system, rRNA genes, antibiotic drug developmentInvention SummaryBackground: A mutational analysis of rRNA is essential for elucidating the molecular mechanism of translation, but has been hindered in prokaryotes and eukaryotes by the repetitive nature of genes.  Researchers at Tufts University have developed a simple genetic system for studying ribosomes using the extensively characterized rRNA genes of E. coli.  The system consists of an E. coli strain with all chromosomal rRNA operons inactivated and a plasmid carrying a single rRNA operon.  It has been demonstrated that homogenous mutant rRNA molecules are expressed in this strain from the plasmid-borne operon and that cellular rRNA species can be manipulated by exchanging rRNA plasmids.  The team has also succeeded in generating pure hybrid ribosome populations in vivo with E. coli ribosomal proteins and foreign rRNA molecules.Applications:This invention provides a method for identifying compounds, e.g., antibiotics or antimicrobials by selecting the compound capable of inhibiting proliferation of an antibiotic resistant rrn operon alter bacterium.  This could also be applied to multi-drug resistant rrn operon alter bacterium.Advantages:The ability of prokaryotic organisms to survive and develop single and multi-drug resistance has been observed from the earliest use of the first antimicrobial agents.  This invention provides a simple genetic system with rRNA genes that can elucidate the molecular mechanism of translation and would reveal novel and highly specific targets for antibiotic drug compounds.Licensing:The patent application is available under a non-exclusive license."," Research Reagents","http://www.tufts.biz/cgi-bin/tech_search.cgi?r=1&case=T000678","mta@tufts.edu617-636-6650mta@tufts.edu","Tufts University"
"2025","Licensable Technology","In vivo selection systems for evolving the specificity of endonucleases and inteins","Liu, David R.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Laboratory directed evolution of enzymes with tailor-made DNA cleavage specificities can provide new tools for the site-specific manipulation of genomes for both basic research and gene therapy applications. Since homing endonucleases (HE) are highly specific in their recognition and cleavage of long DNA sequences (14-40 bp), they may be ideally suited for these purposes. However, as there are relatively few HEs available, a method for creating HEs with altered specificities would be important in broadening the potential applicability of these enzymes to gene manipulation and therapy.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Harvard researchers have developed an efficient in vivo directed evolution system for the selection and assaying of HEs with altered DNA cleavage specificities. One embodiment of the strategy utilizes a pair of matched plasmids to link desired HE catalytic activity to the survival of the E. coli cell harboring the HE library member gene. One plasmid contains a cleavage site of interest together with a caged toxic gene, while the second plasmid encodes the candidate HE. Only cells in which the HE is successful in cleaving the target site can survive (linearization of the plasmid with the toxic gene results in its rapid degradation). The system may utilize both positive and negative selection pressures, either to favor the cleavage of a desired target sequence or to disfavor the cleavage of non-target sequences. The researchers used this system to successfully evolve mutant I-Scel HEs with altered DNA cleave specificities. This two-plasmid in vivo selection system is highly efficient, easy to use, involves simple plasmid transformation and cell plating rather than requiring protein overexpression, purification, and the performance of in vitro cleavage assays,  and should be applicable to other kinds of endonucleases and inteins. In addition, in vivo selection allows enzyme activities to be assayed in the living cell under complex conditions that in some cases may be more relevant than artificial in vitro conditions. The related patent and patent applications describe additional selection systems. Example two-plasmid selection system #1. The pBar2-sites plasmid contains nuclease cleavage sites of interest and places expression of an amber nonsense mutated barnase gene under control of the arabinose-induced and glucose-repressed pBAD promoter. The pSupE-nuclease plasmid expresses the HE enzyme together with an amber suppressor tRNA. Example two-plasmid selection system #2. pEndoSce is a low-copy plasmid that expresses I-SceI or a library of I-SceI variants under control of the araBAD promoter. pCcdB is a high-copy plasmid containing multiple copies of the desired or undesired recognition sequence distributed between two locations. This plasmid also expresses the toxic protein CcdB under control of the lac promoter. In the presence of IPTG, nucleases capable of cleaving pCcdB enable cells to survive (positive selection). pCcdB also expresses chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (Cat). In the presence of chloramphenicol and in the absence of IPTG, nucleases capable of cleaving pCcdB induce cell death (negative selection)."," Drug Discovery Tools  |   Research Tools  |   Research Reagents  |   Research Tools","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=2025","Vivian Berlin, (617) 496-0474","Harvard University"

"21650","Licensable Technology","2-Aminoadipic acid biomarker and Therapy for Diabetes and glucose-related metabolic disorder risk","Gerszten, Robert E; Wang, Thomas J","Technology: 
The inventors have identified a metabolic biomarker, 2-aminoadipic acid (2-AAA), which is useful in determining the risk of developing glucose-related metabolic disorders (GRMD)such as diabetes; as well as a therapeutic agent to treat GRMD.

GRMD refers to any disease characterized by a defect in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. Concentrations of 2-AAA in clinical samples obtained from subjects with GRMD, are predictive of development of GRMD in normoglycemic individuals. 
Individuals with high plasma 2-AAA levels had up to a 4-fold risk of future diabetes. The circulating 2-AAA levels were elevated up to 12 years prior to the onset of diabetes. 
Furthermore, studies show that administration of 2-AAA to mice confers a significant decrease in fasting glucose levels.

Applications:
1.  Diagnostic biomarker ? to differentiate normal and diabetic individuals
2.  Therapeutic agent ? to treat diabetes and other GRMDs

Advantages:
1.  Strength of the human data: The invention is based on analysis of two well-characterized cohorts with long follow-up periods. Statistical analysis with adjustment to known factors associated with diabetes was done, showing that 2-AAA is a strong predictor of diabetes.
2.  Convenience of use: 
Measurement of 2-AAA levels in the clinical sample/s can be conducted using a kit, which comprises of all the required reagents for the 2-AAA measurements and software to analyze the results and further facilitate the use of this technology.
3.  Minimally-invasive technology: 2-AAA is measured in an easily accessible body fluid (plasma or blood) and can be done as an outpatient procedure.
4.  Therapeutic potential: 2-AAA can additionally serve as therapeutic agent, to reduce systemic glucose levels in a subject.

"213","Licensable Technology","2-Aza-2-Desamino Analogues of 5,8 Dideazafolic Acid - PT594 Folic Acid Analogue","Rosowsky, A","Methotrexate, an antifolate drug, has been used for many years in the treatment of cancer, but its use has often been by limited resistance of tumor cells to its effects.  The potential therapeutic significance of folic acid analogues targeted against thymidylate synthase (TS) as opposed to DHFR led to the synthesis of quinazoline analogues.  However, their clinical usefulness was hampered by hepatic and renal toxicities.  The toxicity problem spurred the development of a second-generation family of folate-based TS inhibitors, which were weaker binders of purified TS in vitro, but also resulted in an increased inhibitory potency against intact cells in culture.

A researcher has synthesized folate analogues in which C2 and the associated H or methyl substituent of the standard desamino-5,8-dideazafolic acid compound have been replaced by nitrogen and a lone electron pair.  These changes were made on the theory that (i) removal of H or Me might enable the molecule to extend more deeply into the active site pocket of the enzyme, and (ii) N2 might interact with active site residues by H-bonding, either directly or via a molecule of ordered water.  Both of these properties were expected to be favorable for TS binding.

Applications/Advantages: The compounds of the invention are potent inhibitors of DNA synthesis in mammalian cells. By inhibiting the conversion by the enzyme TS of dUMP into dTMP, a precursor necessary for DNA synthesis in treated cells is retarded. Thus, the compound is useful for the treatment of cancer or psoriasis, conditions characterized by overproliferation of cells."," Therapeutics - Drugs","http://www.dfci.harvard.edu/res/technology/available.asp?case_number=213&keywords=&category_id=1&category_name=Therapeutics","Ojas Mehta, Phone (617) 632-5807, Fax (617) 632-4012, Email Ojas_Mehta@dfci.harvard.edu","Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"

Barium alginate fibers have an index of refraction very close to that of the hydrogel holding the cells, which eliminates light refraction and enables visualization of the cells via microscopy. Barium alginate paper is very simple, rapid and inexpensive to prepare and requires no specialized laboratory equipment. The simplicity, rapidity and cost-effectiveness of this fabrication process means that barium alginate paper can be used to quickly and conveniently set up live cell cultures. Furthermore, due to the desired optical properties of this paper, these cells can then be imaged in real time. For example, the Whitesides laboratory was able to image GFP-expressing cells via fluorescent microscopy throughout the full thickness of one sheet of barium alginate paper.  Other cellular bioassays and techniques, such as paper-based transmittance colorimetric assays (POCKET), will also benefit greatly from the optically transparent nature of this barium alginate paper.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Dr. George Whitesides’ lab recently developed a novel paper scaffold which can be impregnated with a hydrogel containing cells and then layered, thereby generating a 3D cell culture with easily-controlled spatial distributions, densities, and other desired properties. Layers of sheets containing cells can be stacked to mimic various tissues, and destacked for cellular analyses and assays. This 3D cell culture platform is simple to make in the laboratory, versatile, easy to manipulate, and does not require specific expertise, or uncommon instrumentation. For more information, click  here.It would also be desirable to be able to image cells in-situ once they have been cultured, without having to extract them from their 3D matrix.  Ordinary paper, formed from cellulose fibers, has a different index of refraction than the medium containing the cells, and therefore scatters light, which impedes microscopic imaging.  The Whitesides laboratory has developed a way of overcoming this obstacle, and has combined the simplicity and versatility of paper-based 3D cell cultures with the desired optical properties that allow live imaging of cells."," Biomaterials","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3718","Mick Sawka, (617) 496-3830","Harvard University"

A non-coding RNA region (ncRNA) involved in the regulation of x-chromosome silencing is a novel biomarker for pluripotent stem cells.  The expression of the number and type of these ncRNA is tightly associated with the differentiated state of stem cells, and with overall cell health.  Using  RNA Fluorescent In-Situ Hybridization (FISH),  pluripotent stem cells and/or stem cell cultures that have not yet entered the differentiation pathway can be easily visualized and identified.  Preliminary evidence suggests that the method may also be useful in identifying human cancer stem cells.

The method can visually assess the differentiation status of all mammalian cells enabling selection of cells or cultures at the desired state of differentiation.  Suitable for use in agricultural or laboratory research, or in clinical settings where selection of undifferentiated stem cells is crucial.  

Advantages:

They are crucial for applications that demand mechanical degrees of freedom or optical isolation from the environment, a key requirement in the fabrication of both optical and mechanical resonators. Current fabrication techniques for suspended structures are limited to specific material systems, leading to a search for alternate nanomachining procedures.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:This technology is a bulk nanomachining methodology for fabricating suspended sub-micron and nanoscale nanobeam photonic and mechanical elements. It is based on standard planar fabrication processes (i.e. optical or electron beam lithography and plasma etching), but is able to fabricate suspended nanobeam structures from a starting bulk material (i.e. a single-crystal or thick film). In essence, the bulk nanomachining methodology “carves out” suspended nanobeam elements from a given material. The process is fundamentally different from conventional surface nanomachining of free-standing structures in that there is no thin film heterolayer structure, and an isotropic wet chemical etch is not used to sacrificially remove any sub-surface layer. Instead, the proposed process makes exclusive use of anisotropic plasma etching to etch the bulk material from two slanting opposite angles. The result is a bulk nanomachining process which yields suspended, triangular cross-section nanobeam photonic elements.  The key breakthrough of this process is the ability to create suspended structures from a single crystal diamond bulk material, for optical resonators and mechanical resonators.

Mauney and Estrada have developed a method of engineering a synthetic biomaterial to support the regeneration of damaged tissues, particularly for use in the bladder. Inspired by the stem-cell scaffold work of Dr. Atala, formerly in Boston Children’s Urology Department, Dr. Mauney and Estrada sought an improved technique for treating bladders damaged by spina bifida, spinal cord injuries, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s and other diseases. ||

Utilizing a novel process for refining silk into a versatile biomaterial, the team has created a bi-layer silk scaffold, comprised of a foam layer that allows for ingrowth of host tissues and a non-porous layer that seals the wound site. The multi-layer scaffold technology is unique and provides the benefits of sealing fluid contents present in hollow organs at the time of surgical integration (non-porous barrier layer) while providing a porous layer for host tissue integration. ||

The material is capable of being fabricated into foams, weaves, meshes or scaffolds, all of which have the capability of being elastic, porous, or stiff for maximum effectiveness and a wide variety of use cases. Importantly, the material is ascellular, which means it can be used “off the shelf” and avoids the barriers inherent with cell-seeded constructs. The material is also inert and biodegradable, which will encourage the growth of new tissue and could eliminate the need for additional surgeries. ||

Preliminary results in a porcine model of augmentation cytoplasty have demonstrated remarkable support of regeneration of innervated, vascularized smooth muscle and urothelial tissues with structural, mechanical, and functional properties comparable to native tissue.

"11179","Licensable Technology","A chimeric IL-10 Immunoglubulin fusion protein to treat Adenocarcinomas","Erdman, Susan; Fox, James G; Horwitz, Bruce ; Davidson, Anne","The Technology:
The inventors believe that  a chimeric IL-10 molecule with an extended serum half-life may be effective in treating adenocarcinomas where tumors are characterized by the over-expression of a particular oncogene, Pim 1. The method is expected to be effective against such adenocarcinomas regardless of their tissue of origin and regardless of whether there has been a prior inflammatory condition. Research results suggest that IL-10 is probably exerting its therapeutic effects by suppressing IL-6. This suggests that other inhibitors of IL-6 should also be effective against adenocarcinomas over-expressing Pim-1, especially in cases where IL6 is also over-expressed.

In vitro data generated by the inventors suggests that a chimeric protein in which IL-10 was fused to the constant region of murine IgG2a has the biological properties of IL-10 but has an extended serum half-life (10 days). In an immunodeficient mouse model infected with H. hepaticus, a lower bowel pathogen that induces inflammation and cancer, 92% of mice dosed with control Ig for 1 week were found to have cancer, while none of the mice treated with IL-10-Ig over the course of one week were found to have cancer. In another mouse model of GI cancer not associated with inflammation, preliminary data showed that untreated mice had an average of 63 tumors while treated mice had an average of 18 tumors. Based on these findings, the inventors believe that IL-10-Ig or a similar reagent could prove useful in the treatment of GI cancer regardless of its association with inflammation. Furthermore, they also believe that IL-10-Ig or a similar reagent could prove useful in treatment of breast and prostate cancer.

Application:
Use of IL-10-Ig or a similar reagent for the treatment of adenocarcinomas.

Advantages:
An alternative treatment option for adenocarcinomas."," Therapeutic","http://www.partners.org/techtransfer/availabletechnologies/default.asp","Amita Joshi, aajoshi@partners.org, 617-954-9526","Brigham and Women's Hospital"

The inventors have developed serum-based methods for diagnosing multiple sclerosis (MS) and for distinguishing between relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and secondary-progressive MS (SPMS). Serum levels of the 15-oxysterols 15-KA and 15-KE are upregulated in both RRMS and SPMS compared with those found in healthy (unaffected) controls. In contrast, 15-HC levels are only upregulated in serum samples from patients with SPMS, the progressive phase of MS, but not in RRMS. This novel biomarker-based diagnostic approach was tested in serum samples from MS patients and a mouse model of MS.

In addition, the inventors have identified a signaling pathway in the progression of SPMS.  The inhibition of poly (ADP ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) a key enzyme in the pathway that suppresses axonal loss and progressive disability in a mouse model for SPMS, thus providing a new promising therapeutic target for SPMS. This finding offers a new therapeutic use in MS for established inhibitors of PARP1. 

Applications: 
-	Differentiate between RRMS and SPMS in clinical practice and in drug development
-	Monitor disease progression
-	Drug discovery target
-	Potential treatment for therapeutically-challenging SPMS

Certain analogs of uridine and deoxyuridine have been synthesized and used in a variety of applications.  For example, deoxyribouridine analogs containing a 5-amino group have been prepared and used as anticancer, antiviral, and antibacterial agents.  In other cases, 5-amino deoxyribouridine analogs have been made with fluorescent compounds for use in DNA sequencing and microarray technology.  This success has led scientist to search for new 5-amino deoxyribouridine analogs as well as platforms for their use.  As for commercial applications, it can be used as a drug discovery platform in genomic research for anticancer, antiviral, and antibacterial therapies in academic and industrial research laboratories.  The labeled analogs can also be used in microarray and nucleic acid sequencing applications.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:This invention consists of novel 5-amino deoxyribouridine analogs.  The analogs are labeled with a radioactive or fluorescent moiety and incorporated into nucleic acid by PCR for use in genomic research applications.  One assay design involves a fluorescent 5-amino deoxyribouridine DNA analog as a target for the discovery of DNA binding agents.  The DNA binding agents (peptides, proteins, small molecules) represent lead anticancer, antiviral, and antibacterial therapies.Fluorescently labeled 5-amino-2'-deoxyuridine analogs, in contrast to a natural 2'-deoxyuridine nucleotides are excellent substrates for base specific cleavage with oxidizing agents.  The use of oxidizing agents to cleave uracil bases in a labeled nucleic acid is a tool to identify the specificity of the DNA binding agents.

The initial binding fragments are readily identified by various biophysical methods, including Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Common NMR methods include Saturation Transfer Difference (STD) or water Logsy in combination with Inter-Ligand nuclear Overhauser Enhancement (iLOE) experiments. One major challenge for FBDD is that it is very difficult to construct a ‘perfect’ linker or fragment extension that contributes positively to the free energy of binding. Successful linking of two fragments has very rarely been accomplished in practice, even when a high resolution structure of the protein-fragments complex is available.It is therefore highly desirable that fragment linking and fragment extension is coupled with facile high throughput synthesis and screening methods. Another challenge of FBDD is that the extended or linked fragments often do not exhibit a sufficiently complex 3-dimensional shape to bind and inhibit protein-protein interaction (PPI) surfaces.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:The present invention enables generation of a large number of rigid compounds that incorporate one or more protein binding fragments in a large number of three dimensional orientations, while presenting ample additional functionalities and geometries for interaction with the target protein.As a proof of concept, this novel drug discovery platform was applied for the discovery of new protein inhibitors of the oncogenic complex MCT-1/DENR and the immunomodulatory complex calcineurin/NFAT.

The candidate vaccines developed and tested to date have been safe and well tolerated, and nearly all, with varying degrees of success, have produced HIV-specific immune responses; several candidates have undergone, or are undergoing, Phase II evaluation. As of July 2005, two Phase III vaccine trials of first-generation rgp120 vaccine candidates have been completed; these trials failed to show efficacy.  Functionally important epitopes of HIV glycoproteins are masked by glycosylation, trimerisation and receptor-induced conformational changes making it difficult to block with neutralizing antibodies.  By focusing on transition state intermediates, such as gp41's pre-hairpin intermediate, broadly neutralizing antibodies may be produced, preventing issues from previous HIV vaccines from developing.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:HIV infection generally induces a strong antibody response to the envelope glycoprotein, the sole antigen on the virion surface.  Most of the induced antibodies are ineffective in preventing infection, however, as they are either non-neutralizing or narrowly isolate-specific.  Only three broadly neutralizing antibodies have been detected that recognize one of tree relatively conserved regions on the envelope protein: the CD4 binding site, carbohydrates on the outer gp120 surface, and a segment of the gp41 ectodomain.Conformational changes in gp120 result in its dissociation with gp41, leading to a cascade or refolding events in gp41.  One of the transitional states of gp41 refolding is known as the ""pre-hairpin intermediate.""

This is a self-assembling gel composed of FDA generally recognized as safe (GRAS) agents for the encapsulation and local delivery of drugs to disease sites.  An important aspect of this technology is the enzyme-specific disassembly of the gel. These components enable the selective release of drug by enzymes produced by disease sites on-demand during periods of need. An example is a flare-up of rheumatoid arthritis where proinflamatory enzymes are secreted into the synovial fluid. On-demand delivery has been demonstrated in concept via incubation of the gel in arthritic synovial fluid wherein an encapsulated dye was released by specific enzymes. Importantly the gel and encapsulated dye were stable for 3 months and there was no dye release in the presence of enzyme inhibitors. The gel is also stable under shear forces associated with joint movement. This technology could enable the on-demand delivery of anti-inflammatory drugs within arthritic joints. 

Applications:
The treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is a major application for this technology. Through targeting other disease-specific enzymes this technology has broad applicability in cancer, ocular disease, oral disease, gastrointestinal disease, and cardiovascular disease.

Advantages
This technology has the potential to overcome the problem of systemic toxicity and side-effects associated with the long-term use of anti-inflammatory drugs and steroid therapy.

They are mainly used as components in integrated optical circuits or as a transport medium in distant communication systems. A typical optical fiber consists of an inner solid glass core and an outer cladding with a refractive index lower than the core causing light to propagate throughout the fiber. Variations of the waveguide have emerged that include a liquid core and cladding, the subject of the patent filing, Harvard Case 2336, ""Microfluidic liquid-core, liquid-cladding optical waveguides"". While these devices represent significant advances in optical waveguides improvements are still needed. The invention provides a method of establishing lasing radiation through a liquid waveguide in a microfluidic device.The technology could be used as a light source on lab-on-a-chip systems. The waveguide laser has potential benefits in various sensing applications where it is particularly well suited for biological applications.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:The device is capable of producing coherent light using a non-resonant photonic pathway utilizing liquids as core and cladding. The two fluids are not mixed due to immiscibility and/or laminar flow within the channel and the differences in refractive index between the two liquids keeps the light in the inner core. This specific design is highly dynamic and the device can thus be reconfigured and adapted continuously in ways that are not possible with solid-state waveguides. By manipulating the rate of flow and the composition of the liquids the characteristics of the optical system and the laser as such can continuously be modified. Advantages include:-It is possible to continuously change the properties of the liquid core and cladding to change the properties of the waveguide and laser.-Small (<10 microns) single-mode liq/liq waveguides are easily obtained through the use of pressure-driven flow in large (>100 microns) and easily fabricated channels.

Examples include electrocardiography (EKG) and electroencephalography (EEG) for surveillance of the heart and brain, respectively.  Anticipatory next-generation medical devices are beginning to monitor other time-dependent signals, such as walking gait, in order to remotely determine the health of patients and allow for quicker medical intervention when such intervention if necessary.  This algorithm will find application in comparing patient signals with signals associated with medical events.For Manufacturing:Industries that rely on strict quality control in their process engineering, such as the pharmaceutical and chemical industries, often use chromatographic data to evaluate whether a certain process is performing as desired.  This data takes the form of signal over time and engineers are trained to visually observe abnormalities in this graph. The algorithm presented here can be used to quantify the quality of chromatographic data mathematically rather than visually.  This can be advantageous for reducing user error and expanding the number graphs that can be simultaneously monitored.For Research:The burgeoning fields of tissue engineering and stem cell therapy routinely transform one cell-type into another.  Often the success of this transformation is determined by gene expression over time.  There is currently a focus on quality control of the therapeutic cells, but determining the exact state of the cell can be difficult. The algorithm presented here will allow for gene expression patterns to be compared to standards and the results quantified in a meaningful way.  This process may be useful for both the production of therapeutic cells and subsequently ensuring cell identity before use.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Current computational methods allow for two time-uncertain series of data to be matched to each other, but cannot account for how likely this match was to occur by chance.  Consequently, the chance of such a match being a false-positive is not quantified. This lack of confidence is problematic when it is important to classify a time series as signifying a positive or negative result, or when one wants to state that two time series are likely related.The algorithm presented here was developed by Harvard mathematicians to address this unmet challenge. First, two time-series, one or both of which are time-uncertain, are compared and a maximum covariance (or other ‘goodness of fit’ metric) is determined.  This maximum covariance can be determined by any of the well established methods in the field.  Next, one of the two series is selected to be randomized under the constraint that it maintains the same statistical characteristics as the original.  The non-randomized series is then compared to the random series and a maximum covariance is determined.  This process is repeated many times.  The result is a certain ratio of random series having an equal or greater maximum covariance than the original series.  This ratio represents the possibility that the similarity between the two original series could have arisen by chance.With this advance, time-series data can not only be correlated but the quality of this correlation can be quantified.  This allows for the rejection of a correlation if it is likely to have happened by chance alone."," Software/Algorithms","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3929","Sam Liss, (617) 495-4371","Harvard University"

The inventors have created a new technique for CT image analysis which provides accurate, reproducible quantitative measurement of thin-layered and fine structures.  

Applications:
In addition to drug screening applications, this method can be used in the following clinical:

-     The method is adaptable to any make or model CT scanner.

"02347","Licensable Technology","A Microfluidic Device to Control Flow of Fluids","Toner, Mehmet ; Irimia, Daniel","Technology:
The microfluidic device has been designed to control the mixing of fluids, particularly for cell lysis. There are two separate channels, one for each liquid, which then flow into a third channel connected by the first two channels. The first channel contains the cells that need to be lysed and the second channel contains a lysis solution. The channel angles and sizes allows for the fluids placed into the device to divide to form segments of controlled volume, which are then brought together to initiate mixing and the lysing of the cells. 

Application:
The primary application is the use of this microfludic device for the effective mixing of very small volume of fluids with several bio-chemical applications notably for the lysis of cells to collect DNA, RNA, proteins, etc.

Advantages:
- Capability of automation and processing of very small volume individual samples
-The use of fluid expansion to manipulate the separated liquid volumes and achieve active mixing
- Ability to control fluid volume separation and mixing
- Use of magnetic beads for capturing and manipulation of specific molecules released during cell lysis
- Ability to observe cell manipulation and lysis via transmitted light microscopy
- Capability of integration into other microfluidic devices

The technology offered here expands the reach of current MR applications by increasing the speed and resolution of existing systems. The resolution of traditional high-field MRI systems is typically around 100 microns. The technology offered here provides a 10x to 100x increase in resolution over existing technology. Additionally, the advantages of this technology lead to a range of new applications. In the medical field, this technology produces the ability to observe tiny changes, otherwise invisible, for diagnosing delicate structures things such as fine-scale brain lesions. In addition, this technology can be implemented in open MR systems which helps accommodate claustrophobic and large patients as well as diagnose orientation specific ailments. In the security field this technology allows one to scan objects from a distance much greater than traditional technologies. In all areas this technology improves scanning speed by up to 50%.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:This technology is for using a high field MR system to record interference patterns within biological phantoms combined with new spatial encoding methods to give contrast at resolution limits far exceeding traditional gradient-based encoding schemes. This interference-based approach can be used to initiate a new field of high field MR imaging.The principal advantage of MR at high field is the concomitant increase in signal-to noise ratio (SNR). However, at high field strength, the excitation wavelength becomes commensurate with the field of view (FOV). For example, at 7 T, the free space wavelength corresponds to about 1 m. The dielectric constant in a biological sample can be as high as 80 due to the high water content, and at a spin precession frequency of 300 MHz, this corresponds to a wavelength inside tissue of less than 15 cm. The operating wavelength is thus comparable to the diameter of most in vivo FOVs. To this end, both temporal and spatial variations of the excitation field must be taken into account, as well as the expected increase in field conductivity. For these reasons, we find that the propagation of radiation at ultra high fields (> 4 T) generates new phenomena commonly observed in quantum optics but traditionally negligible in NMR experiments, including phase modulation of the excitation field as well as wave interference.Advantages include:• Large field of view (FOV) imaging• Higher spatial and temporal resolution• Open architecture MRI scanners with pulsed B0 field"," Instrumentation  |   Medical Imaging  |   Sensing/Imaging","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3881","Sam Liss, (617) 495-4371","Harvard University"

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have demonstrated health benefits including decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, and cancer.  Dr. Charles Serhan, one of the most pre-eminent researchers in the area of omega-3 fatty acids and inflammation has identified a previously unknown pathway involving biosynthesis of potent anti-inflammatory lipid mediators derived from the essential omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).  This new pathway led Dr. Serhan to the discovery of a novel class of DHA derivative compounds, which he has called the (maresins).  These endogenous lipid mediators have been shown to possess potent anti-inflammatory activity.  

APPLICATION:
Treatment of inflammatory conditions, such as arthritis, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease and allergies.

Since studies have shown that the inflammatory process is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and cardiovascular disease, the maresins offer the potential for treatment of these diseases as well. 

ADVANTAGES:
- This new class of compounds provides a new market opportunity for treatment of inflammatory conditions with more potency than omega-3 dietary supplements.

"2193","Licensable Technology","A novel assay for identifying biological targets of DNA binding agents","Myers, Andrew G.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Chemotherapeutic DNA-binding compounds exert their effects, in part, by preventing DNA synthesis and initiating events that leads to apoptotic death.  Despite the excellent antiproliferative activity of these compounds, though, elucidating their particular modes of action (i.e. their biological targets) has been difficult. Given this uncertainty, there is a high demand for the development of assays that can identify these essential drug effectors.  This technology is an excellent candidate to be provided as a kit with materials ready to perform the assay. The kit may include polynucleotides, affinity resins, chemical compounds with known targets or mechanism of action, as well as buffers, reagents, purified proteins, antibodies, cell lysates, or the like.  The assay can be used as a tool in either industry or an academic research lab to discover agents and biological effectors for the treatment of cancer.  The market for this technology is large because it has the potential to be used at any research laboratory (industrial or academic) in the world.   Furthermore, the number of candidate DNA-binding compounds to be used in this assay spans an endless and broad spectrum of species, from plants to marine animals.  Moreover, the capabilities of synthetic chemists to generate analogs and intermediates only add to this number.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:The platform for the assay includes a polynucleotide/DNA binding agent binary complex fused to a solid support such as a resin.  It can be used to locate by affinity chromatography a biological target in a cell lysate, extraceullar fluid, serum, plasma, blood or any other solution or suspension thought to contain the biological target.  In one example, the assay was used to discover GAPDH as a potential target for Saframycin A analogues, an antiproliferative agent believed to function by covalently modifying duplex DNA.  This is the first time that GAPDH has been identified as a potential target for chemotherapeutic intervention, which is all the more intriguing in light of recent evidence of a role for GAPDH as a key transcriptional coactivator necessary for entry into S phase.   This platform represents a next-generation method for identification of novel chemotherapeutic agents.Advantages:  This next-generation DNA-affinity linked assay is compatible with all chemical compounds and biological targets that interact with duplex DNA.   By elucidating the biological targets of current DNA binding agents, the assay may lead to the discovery of better pharmaceutical agents with similar modes of action.  The first in class assay is also amenable to high throughput screening techniques-including robotics, combinatorial chemistry, microfluidics, and computer analysis.  For example, a collection of compounds (combinatorial library) or a historical collection of compounds of a pharmaceutical company may be used to screen for potential effectors."," Drug Discovery Tools  |   Drug Discovery Tools  |   Drug Discovery Tools","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=2193","Vivian Berlin, (617) 496-0474","Harvard University"

It arises naturally from a new design paradigm for spatio-spectral sampling.  The proposed scheme offers the potential to significantly reduce hardware complexity in a wide variety of applications, while at the same time improving output color image quality.  Applications include:  -CMOS or CCD image sensor for digital still cameras and digital video cameras-Color image processingINNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:In digital imaging applications, data are typically obtained via a spatial sub-sampling procedure implemented as a color filter array (CFA). CFA assigns a separate primary color to each pixel by placing a filter of that color over the pixel. The most well known CFA is the Bayer pattern which uses a checkerboard pattern with alternating rows of filters. The Bayer filter has twice as many green pixels as red or blue and takes advantage of the human eye's tendency to see green luminance as the strongest influence in defining image quality.  Despite its widespread use, the Bayer pattern imposes inherent limitations upon the design of interpolation and de-noising methods. In particular, the rectangular sub-sampling lattice associated with Bayer-patterned data induces spectral copies of the difference signals centered about the set of frequencies. Hence, by reducing allowable bandwidth, the Bayer spectral periodization ""penalizes"" the very horizontal and vertical features which are most likely to appear in typical ""real world"" images. The proposed scheme, an alternative to the Bayer pattern, offers the potential to significantly reduce hardware complexity in a wide variety of applications, while at the same time improving output color image quality."," Software/Algorithms  |   Sensing/Imaging  |   Software/Algorithms","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=2840","Sam Liss, (617) 495-4371","Harvard University"

Accordingly, the protein has been renamed attractin). The serum DPPIV costimulates the T lymphocyte response to the recall antigen, tetanus toxoid. However, unlike the membrane form, the serum protein does not bind ADA-1, and there are sequence differences between the two.

Applications/Advantages: The serum DPPIV is a potent T cell costimulator, and may accordingly be used to enhance immune responses. This technology is expected to be especially useful for the treatment of immunosuppression in a patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and having the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).

This technology provides a new method for the formation of DFHR inhibitors that share a similar chemical structure, and are comprised of an aromatic group linked to a heteroaromatic group by a methylene linkage. Specifically, the reaction scheme involves the metal-catalyzed coupling of an organozinc species to an aromatic halide or heteroaromatic halide via a methylene linkage (the metal catalyst used in the reaction is a group 10 metal such as nickel or palladium).

Further, this technology directly yields a saturated carbon-carbon bond (unlike a scheme using the pre-existing Heck reaction, which would require further steps to reduce the subsequent double or triple bond). Compounds of the invention are useful to combat parasitic infections that infect HIV-positive patients; the lipophilic DHFR inhibitors provided by this technology are especially well suited for anti-Pneumocystis carinii (Pc) and anti-Toxoplasma gondii (Tg) therapy.

Neural stem cells have been identified in the CNS, but current sources (spinal cord and lateral ventricle of the forebrain) are critical for normal brain function and surgery in these areas can lead profound neurological deficits.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:The Cardozo lab has identified filum terminale as a novel source of autologous neural stem cells. In addition, they have developed methods to grow and maintain the cells for long periods of time in tissue culture as well as to induce the differentiation of the cells into neurons and glia. Filum terminale is a vestige structure of the caudal end of the spinal cord that plays no functional role in the postnatal nervous system. It is a remnant of the nervous system that early in development provides embryo’s vestigial tail. Filum terminale is surgically easily accessible, routinely and safely sectioned in patients with tethered cord syndrome. Stem cells from filum terminale could be harvested from patients suffering brain and spinal cord injury or neurodegenerative diseases, expended and differentiated in tissue culture and transplanted back into the patient.   This discovery has a huge potential in cell replacement therapy. Neural stem cells from filum terminale can be harvested throughout life and the availability of autologous neural stem cells overcomes the problem of tissue rejection that accompanies the transplantation of non-autologous cells. The isolation of stem cells from filum terminale represents a major advance in neural stem cells research and cell-replacement therapy: -     It does not involve surgery in a CNS region essential to normal brain function-     It provides reliable cells and expendable nervous tissue-     The autologous cells obtained could be transplanted back into the patient without immunological rejection."," Tissue Engineering","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=2950","Michal Preminger, (617) 432-0920","Harvard University"

Technology: This technology is a novel compound that can both detect and kill pests (eg. insects, nematodes).  When the compound is ingested by a pest it can be killed by ambient light, This light driven lethality is dependent on the presence of an enzyme produced by the pest, accordingly; (1) the pest will fluoresce (enabling its detection) and (2) reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced as a result of the photosensitizer being activated by light (resulting in killing of the pest).

Background: The compound is made of at least two photosensitizers linked together by an enzyme cleavable molecule.  When linked together, the two photosensitizers are unable to be activated by light due to steric hindrance and thus are not toxic.  When the linker is cleaved by the pest enzyme, the photosensitizer units are released from one another and can be activated by light to produce lethal  reactive oxygen species (ROS).

"333","Licensable Technology","A Novel Tumor Marker","Chen, L","Common tumor markers are largely limited to activated oncogenes; oncogene products have proven difficult to use as reliable markers due to their relatively low level of expression.  This invention is based on the discovery of a novel protein, TC1, which is a robust tumor marker particularly for invasive and metastatic tumors.  Recent studies indicate the level of TC1 mRNA in tumor tissue is much greater than the level in adjacent normal tissue.  Moreover, evidence now suggests that differential expression of TC1 may be associated with cancer progression and aggressiveness of the disease

Applications/Advantages: The TC1 protein is useful as a tumor marker especially for colorectal, breast, and gastrointestinal tumors.  The TC1 protein is also a useful marker in general for tumor cell invasion and metastasis.  Accordingly, TC1 protein promises to serve as a target to prevent tumor cell metastasis and invasion of additional organs.  A truncated portion of TC1 that retains the invasive and metastatic biological activities of the full-length molecule will be useful for screening of potential TC1 antagonists. The technology also features nucleotide probes based on the TC1 sequence that are useful for PCR-based tumor detection and in situ hybridization of tumor tissue sections.  Further, the invention encompasses antibodies specific for TC1; TC1 is detectable in various patient body fluids using a monoclonal antibody specific for a TC1 epitope.  Monoclonal antibodies specific for TC1 may be used for tumor imaging to localize tumor position and size."," Diagnostics/Biomarkers","http://www.dfci.harvard.edu/res/technology/available.asp?case_number=333&keywords=&category_id=5&category_name=Diagnostics","Ruth Emyanitoff, Phone (617) 632-4010, Fax (617) 632-4012, Email Ruth_Emyanitoff@dfci.harvard.edu","Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"

"2387","Licensable Technology","A self-sustained soliton oscillator utilizing nonlinear transmission lines and spectrum-preservice nonlinear amplification","Ham, Donhee","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Conventional traveling wave oscillators that require high-speed clock signals generally employ a linear transmission line over which sinusoidal waves are propagated. In such systems, linear amplifiers are employed to overcome resistive losses present in the transmission line so as to maintain the signal strength of the traveling sinusoidal wave and permit oscillation. While such linear oscillator systems have enjoyed wide acceptance in the communications industry, system designers have expressed a willingness to consider nonlinear approaches.Improved nonlinear pulse oscillator methods and apparatus may be employed in the areas of high-speed electronics, electrical and optical communication systems, information encoding and decoding, pulsed power technology, spectroscopy, and neural networks.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:The invention describes new methods and apparatus for implementing stable self-starting and self-sustaining electrical nonlinear pulse (e.g., soliton, cnoidal wave, or quasi-soliton) oscillators. In one embodiment, a nonlinear pulse oscillator is implemented as a closed loop structure that comprises a nonlinear transmission line, a high-pass filter, and a nonlinear amplifier configured to provide a self-adjusting gain as a function of the average voltage of the oscillator signal (i.e., the propagating pulses).In another aspect, an adaptive bias control technique is employed together with the nonlinear gain functionality to ensure robust, stable operation of the oscillator. The implementation of a nonlinear amplifier with adaptive bias control may be viewed conceptually as an electric circuit analog of a saturable absorber, which is configured to effectively reduce distortion to pulses propagating in the oscillator, reject perturbations to the system, and ensure the selection and propagation of a single mode. In yet another aspect, one or more high pass filters employed in the oscillator may be particularly configured to facilitate single mode operation. For example, according to one embodiment, the cut-off frequency of one or more high pass filters is particularly selected so as to prohibit collisions of multiple different-amplitude nonlinear pulses. The filter design takes advantage of the fact that collisions of multiple different amplitude solitons or quasi-solitons tend to skew the frequency spectrum of the oscillator toward higher power at lower frequencies. Accordingly, by designing the high pass filter to appropriately attenuate lower frequency spectrum components characteristic of soliton collisions, such collisions are effectively precluded from forming in the oscillator."," ","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=2387","Sam Liss, (617) 495-4371","Harvard University"
"2923","Licensable Technology","A simple device for density-based separation of particles using diamagnetic levitation","Whitesides, George M.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:This inexpensive portable device for measuring the density of a material, or separating materials based on density, has no moving parts, requires no energy source or analyte labeling, is amenable to readout by eye, and is suitable for both routine laboratory use as well as use in resource-poor environments. Many applications of the device take advantage of the fact that a particle's overall density (and therefore levitation height in the device) will change if it is chemically modified in a reaction or if it binds other materials. Applications of this technology include monitoring the progress of solid-phase chemical reactions and detecting target binding for in-vitro diagnostic assays.For solid-phase chemical reactions, the percent conversion of chemical reactions run on polymer bead supports can be easily and rapidly (within seconds to minutes) determined by removing aliquots of beads from the reaction mixture at different time points and measuring their levitation height when placed in the device; this application has been shown to be highly sensitive and to correlate well with NMR data for a wide range of reactions and support resins. For diagnostics, the beads can be functionalized with antibodies, oligonucleotides, proteins, or small molecules to sensitively and specifically detect a binding partner in a test sample; applications range from clinical diagnostic to environmental testing; this concept has been demonstrated by detecting proteins that bind to small molecules on beads.Other suitable applications are detecting biological, chemical, or electrostatic binding events that result in a change in a particle's density, or as a general technique for measuring the density of small quantities of lipophilic or hydrophilic solids or liquids.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Harvard investigators have fabricated a simple, inexpensive, portable, and highly sensitive device for separating particles that differ in density. The basis of separation is the balance of the gravitational and magnetic buoyancy forces acting upon diamagnetic particles (e.g. polystyrene beads) suspended in a paramagnetic medium (e.g. in a vial, cuvette or capillary tube containing a solution of Gd(III) ions) sandwiched between two small solid-state NdFeB magnets. Diamagnetic particles suspended in the paramagnetic solution and placed in the device will distribute themselves in the vial by height according to density -- higher density particles will reach an equilibrium position closer to the bottom of the vial, while lower density particles will be levitated to a position closer to the top of the vial. The density separation range and resolution can be controlled by choice of solvent (aqueous or organic), concentration of paramagnetic ions, or magnetic field strength. Novel chelates of Gd(III) ions have been designed to make the technique compatible with a range of solvents, chemistries, and biological materials. The device has been configured in a microfluidic system for continuous flow particle sorting and collection.-Monitoring Solid-Phase Chemical Reactions:Contemporary drug discovery efforts often involve the construction of combinatorial compound libraries using solid-phase synthesis carried out on polymer beads. However, existing methods of monitoring the progress of solid-phase reactions are reaction-specific, labor-intensive, time consuming, and require the use of expensive spectroscopic equipment (e.g. mass spectroscopy, FTIR, NMR, etc). Discovery chemists need a technique for monitoring solid-phase reactions that is as simple, inexpensive, and widely applicable as thin layer chromatography is for solution phase organic chemistry. Detection of Binding Events for in vitro Diagnostic Assays:A wide variety of strategies are currently used for the qualitative or quantitative detection of complex formation between a diagnostic probe and target analyte, including fluorescent reporter labels or the use of colorimetric or chemiluminescent reactions. Detection methods that do not require the production/detection of such reporter signals, and are interpretable by eye, could offer significant advantages in terms of cost, ease of use, portability, and suitability for resource poor environments."," ","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=2923","Mick Sawka, (617) 496-3830","Harvard University"

"3326","Licensable Technology","A system for the continuous directed evolution of biomolecules","Liu, David R.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Protein engineering by directed evolution has proven useful in conferring desired properties upon a wide variety of biomolecules of interest.  However, with current methods, each round of evolution typically requires days or longer, with frequent intervention by the researcher involving discrete cycles of mutagenesis, transformation or in vitro expression, screening or selection, and gene harvesting and manipulation. Since successful evolution is strongly dependent on the total number of rounds performed, the labor- and time-intensive nature of discrete directed evolution cycles limit many laboratory evolution efforts to a modest number of rounds. A more rapid and automated approach to directed evolution is needed.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Researchers in the laboratory of Professor David Liu have developed a platform that enables the continuous directed evolution of gene-encoded molecules that can be linked to protein production in E. coli. During phage-assisted continuous evolution (“PACE”), successfully evolving genes are transferred from host cell to host cell through a modified M13 filamentous bacteriophage life cycle by linking desired activity to the expression of protein III (pIII; encoded by gene III), and thus to the production of infectious progeny phage. To accomplish this, gene III was deleted from the phage vector and inserted it into an “accessory plasmid” (AP) present in the E. coli host cells. The production of pIII from the AP is dependent upon the activity of the evolving gene(s) on the phage vector and in the absence of this activity is insufficient to support the production of infectious phage. Phage vectors able to induce sufficient production of pIII from the AP will therefore propagate and persist in a continuously diluted lagoon, while phage vectors unable to induce pIII will be washed out over time. Because pIII expression level determines the rate of infectious phage production, the progeny of a phage encoding a mutant gene that results in a higher level of pIII production will infect a larger share of host cells relative to the progeny of a phage encoding a less active gene. Mutants with higher activity will therefore experience a selective advantage until pIII levels are sufficient for maximal infectious phage release.In principle, PACE is capable of evolving any gene that can be linked to pIII production in E. coli, including activities that influence pIII function at the transcriptional, translational, or post-translational levels. Because a wide variety of functions including DNA binding, RNA binding, protein binding, bond-forming catalysis, and a variety of enzyme activities have been linked to the expression of a reporter protein through n-hybrid and other conditional transcription strategies, PACE can be applied to the evolution of many different activities of interest. To date, the investigators have successfully linked and evolved protein-protein binding, recombinase activity, and RNA polymerase activity to phage infectivity in discrete infection assays by creating variants of the AP that associate each of these activities with pIII production. In the example described in the publication referenced below, the T7 RNA polymerase was evolved to recognize the T3 promoter and to initiate transcripts with nucleotides other than G. The PACE system can be assembled entirely from a modest collection of commercially available equipment and does not require the manufacture of any specialized components. PACE proceeds at a rate of several dozen rounds of mutation, selection, and gene replication per day, representing roughly a 100-fold increase over most current protein evolution methods.Overview of the PACE system:  (a) PACE in a single lagoon. Newly arrived host cells are infected with selection phage (SP) encoding library members. Functional library members induce production of pIII from the accessory plasmid (AP) and release progeny capable of infecting new host cells. Non-functional library members do not produce pIII and release only non-infectious progeny. Increased mutagenesis is triggered upon lagoon entry through induction of a mutagenesis plasmid (MP). Host cells flow out of the lagoon on average faster than they can replicate, confining the accumulation of mutations to actively replicating SP. (b) Schematic of the PACE apparatus. Host E. coli cells maintained at constant cell density are continuously fed into the lagoon by peristaltic pump along with chemical inducers at a dilution rate of 1.0-3.2 volumes per hour."," Drug Discovery Tools  |   Research Tools","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3326","Vivian Berlin, (617) 496-0474","Harvard University"

Digital cameras, cellular telephones, wireless data network equipment, audio devices (MP3 players), video devices (DVD players) and high definition television all use ADCs. Less well known, but equally important in their fields, ADCs are used to convert any type of continuous signal into digital data, including measuring voltage and currents, and recording ultrasonic medical images. During conversion, errors can be introduced into the digital data. To minimize errors, the digital data must be continuously calibrated and corrected. Drs. Ham and Sun developed a new calibration technique for ADCs that operate at medium frequencies; also referred to as pipeline ADCs. Audio and video equipment typically use pipeline ADCs. The new calibration technique allows the ADC to generate digital data faster and more accurately than currently available ADCs can. This calibration technique could be used by any ADC maker to improve the performance and reliability of their pipeline converters.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:The new digital data calibration technique allows any pipeline ADC to operate at a speed about 2 bits faster than currently available ADCs. For example, an 8-bit ADC could potentially run at 12 bits, compared to only the 10 bits maximum that might be possibly be achieved today.The increase in speed is a result of when the data calibration is done. Existing ADCs calibrate data twice: initially when the chip is manufactured; and then continually  as a  background process during data conversion. However, the background calibration takes time and it must interrupt ADC operations. As a result, the full bit potential of an ADC cannot be achieved or maintained. The new calibration technique allows for both the initial and continual calibrations to be done in real time; that is, as the data is converted. By operating in real time, the maximum bit resolution of up to 12 bits can be achieved."," ","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3340","Sam Liss, (617) 495-4371","Harvard University"

"2559","Licensable Technology","A transgenic reporter system can be used for recombination-mediated modulation of gene activity in the developing mouse embryo","McMahon, Andrew P.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:The ability to generate specific genetic modifications in mice provides a powerful approach to assess gene function. As such systems allowing conditional genetic modification have been developed; for example, inducible forms of the Cre recombinase from P1 phage have been generated that can catalyze intramolecular recombination between target recognition sequences (loxP sites) in response to ligand.  However, when genetic modifications have been generated in the germ line, the resulting phenotype often only reflects the first time a gene has an influence on a particular biological process. As a consequence it is imperative to develop new models that can help understand better how these genes function.   Wnt1-Cre tamoxifen-inducible recombination can be used to modulate gene activity in developing mouse embryos to study neural development.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:A transgenic reporter system consisting of a tamoxifen-inducible form of Cre recombinase (Cre-ERTM) that can be used for recombination-mediated modulation of gene activity in the developing mouse embryo.  Using the enhancer of the Wnt1 gene to restrict the expression of Cre-ERTM to the embryonic neural tube, we found that a single injection of tamoxifen into pregnant mice induced Cre-mediated recombination within the embryonic central nervous system, thereby activating expression of a reporter gene. Induction is ligand dependent, rapid and efficient. The invention demonstrates that tamoxifen-inducible recombination can be used to effectively modify gene function in the mouse embryo.  The construction of the system was performed as follows:  To express cre within the WntI expression domain, the cDNA for Cre was placed under the control of the Wnt enhancer. Transgenic mouse strains that expressed this construct were mated with the R170 reporter line to determine whether Cre-mediated activation of the reporter could take place within the WntI expression domain.  In embryos carrying both transgenes, b-galactosidase activity is detected within the midbrain by 8.5 post coitum (dpc) and the complete pattern of expression by 11.5 dpc.  Next, Cre fusion proteins were generated using the hormone-binding domain of a mutant mouse estrogen receptor (Cre-ERTM) and placed under the regulation of the WntI enhancer. To determine if recombination occurred in the absence of ligand, we crossed stem cell line R170 and Cre-ERTM and stained for b-galactosidase activity at 11.5 dpc. All embryos determined by genotyping to be carrying both transgenes showed a staining pattern that was indistinguishable from embryos carrying only the reporter, whether pregnant mice were uninjected or injected with corn oil.  When the pregnant mice from this intercross were injected intraperitoneally with 1.0 mg tamoxifen (TM) per day for four consecutive days (from 7.5 to 10.5 dpc) prior to collection at 11.5 dpc a strong and reproducible b-galactosidase staining was obtained in the WntI pattern in all embryos carrying both transgenes.The reporter can be activated within the WntI domain, and activation - which requires intragenic recombination, transcription and translation - occurred in less than 12 hours and is active from 8.0 days dpc in the neural plate of the mouse embryo."," Research Reagents  |   Genomics/Proteomics  |   Therapeutics - Methods  |   Genomics/Proteomics  |   Therapeutics - Methods  |   Genomics/Proteomics","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=2559","Vivian Berlin, (617) 496-0474","Harvard University"
"CCMC   1211","Licensable Technology","A Transgenic Zebrafish model for Melanoma using BRAF and other cell cycle mutan","Zon, Leonard I.","This work has created a zebrafish model of both benign nevi and malignant melanoma, a model that offers faithful recreation of the human melanomagenesis and  attractive adaptability for investigative research. Transgenic zebrafish bearing human, mutated BRAF (V599E) cDNA, expressed in under the melanocytes-specific mitfa (nacre) gene promoter, develop benign, ectopic melanocyte proliferation, resembling human nevi. In a genetic background carrying a p53 mutation [homozygous Met246Lys missense mutation of the zebrafish zp53 gene, corresponding to a mutation seen in human cancers and demonstrated to inhibits radiation-induced apoptosis in the fish], expression of the V599E BRAF in melanocytes leads to the development of melanomas in the fish, arising over time from nevi and displaying characteristic similar to human malignant melanoma. This research has defined a valuable platform for the study of both pre-malignant nevi and malignant melanoma. ||

Zebrafish represent a genetically tractable species, allowing experiments on genetically identical individuals, allowing introduction of new mutations at will, and allowing genetic screens for novel mutations that result in a desired phenotype. Their short generation time and large numbers of offspring allow rapid expansion of new genetic lineages. Zebrafish are large enough to be surgically manipulated (allowing excision of tumors, implantation, transplantation, etc.) yet are small enough to be raised economically in large numbers. The advantage of rearing large numbers of genetically identical fish is manifest both in large scale population studies (where large numbers of identical individuals can be exposed to a limited number of treatments to accurately evaluate weak environmental variables) and in screening (where fish can be exposed to a large number of potential therapeutic compounds for in vivo, high throughput, drug screening). As vertebrates, zebrafish shared the same developmental program of melanocyte generation from neural crest progenitors as seen in mammals, and the mammalian and zebrafish melanocytes share biochemical and cell biological features and share expression of many homologous genes. The fish nevi and melanomas are relevant models for their human counterparts, sharing histological similarities and showing involvement of mutations in homologous genes in melanomagenesis."," Research Tools  |   Drug Discovery Tools","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=1211","Meyer, Abbie, abbie.meyer@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"
"3002","Licensable Technology","A Unique Natural 4-herb Combination for the Treatment of Pain - drug candidate for pain and epilepsy","Schachter, Steven C.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:A non-toxic 4-herb mixture for pain and epilepsy:  The 4-herb pharmaceutical composition comprises or consists essentially of, or consists of processed plant material of a combination of herbs: Scutellaria, Glycyrrhiza, Ziziphus and Paeonia. The composition also has pain-reducing, antiepileptic and neuroprotective activity. For the first time, Harvard researchers have demonstrated utility of the 4-herb mixture as low-toxic neuroprotective agent for epilepsy and pain:•     Neuropathic pain alleviation activity of 4-Herb combination: The combination of four herbs of the present invention provides a synergistic effect with respect to potency and prolonging of the duration of action in treating or reducing pain, such as neuropathic pain or inflammatory pain in a subject.•     4-Herb combination reduces seizures: The combination herb composition, e.g. 4-herb combination, is also useful to prevent the onset of and reduce the severity of a seizure disorder such as epilepsy. For example, the frequency, duration, or severity of seizures is reduced by 25%, 50%, 2-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold or more.•     The 4-Herb combination has low-toxicity: Positive experience of traditional healers suggests that the 4-herb combination herb possess low toxicity which, in turn, implies that the drug can quickly pass through clinical trials. This formulation can be delivered using many different modes of delivery (oral, IV etc.)and can be used as a therapeutic in human and animal systems.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Traditional herbal medicines as a source of new CNS drugs:  Pain management remains a ubiquitous clinical problem. In addition to injury, nearly every disease or pathological condition from arthritis to cancer to HIV infection and diabetes has a major pain component. Pain management for some conditions such as nerve injuries and chronic inflammatory disease has been poor.

"1882","Licensable Technology","A versatile method for accelerated chromosome walking and DNA fingerprinting","Myrick, Kyl V.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:A variety of DNA amplification methods deal with sequence analysis of an uncharacterized region adjacent to a known element. These methods include inverse PCR (iPCR), panhandle PCR, cassette ligation-anchored, and Thermal Asymmetric Interlaced PCR. Despite various degrees of success, a number of drawbacks reduce the accuracy and efficiency of each of these methods.  Unsequenceable domains are frequently poor in restriction enzyme sites or contain heterochromatic DNA, which has few genes and many repeated regions that are difficult to maintain as clones for DNA sequencing.  As a consequence, there is a need to develop new ways to determine these hard-to-sequence regions of nucleic acid.Universal Fast Walking (UFW) is particularly suitable for analyzing transposon sequences and sequences flanking the insertion site of a known transposon or viral element.  Alternatively, the known element is a pathogen, or a natural or constructed gene or chromosome.  Besides direct genome walking, other uses of UFW include high throughput mapping of genome-wide insertional mutagenesis for functional genomics, identifying vector integration sites for gene therapy studies, and tracking of viral replication by detecting the insertional activity that accompanies productive infection, as with retroviruses. The manipulations for running UFW are conducive to automation. The target nucleic acid is RNA, DNA, or cDNA. Thus, another advantage is that the method can utilize RNA as a working material. Earlier methods which require restriction enzyme digestion cannot utilize RNA because it is not cut by restriction endonucleases.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:The invention is a novel method for amplifying or recovering an unknown nucleic acid sequence adjacent to a known nucleic acid sequence.  The method includes the following steps: ­­­­­­Polymerase-catalyzed extension from a known region into an unknown region by a primer-directed synthesis of a first strand-Enzymatic destruction of the first primer, typically using the single-strand-specific enzyme exonucleaseI (exoI)-Strand denaturation and annealing and short extension of a sequence-tagged, random-ended primer across the first strand-Destruction of the second primer and repair of the branched ends in the intermediate products, such that both events are simultaneously achieved by reintroduction of an exonuclease, e.g., exoI, an enzyme which digests single-stranded DNA from the 3' end, causing removal of free primer and trimming of branched DNA back to the branchpoint Polymerase-catalyzed sequence conversion of the repaired ends that results in a complement to the specific sequence tag-Strand denaturation and formation of a lariat or stem-loop or panhandle structure by intrastrand annealing between the tag complement and a copy of the tag at the other end of the strand-Self-primed extension of the lariat; and -Polymerase amplification to generate specific final products. The amplicons are also suitable for standard sequencing, without requiring molecular cloning; it is therefore possible to directly genome walk over a substantial distance, such that the range of the walk in this method is limited only by the capability of the polymerase component that is selected. The high performance of long-distance polymerases indicates that the current range of the UFW approaches may exceed 50 kilobases per walk.  The final products, or amplicons, can also be subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis. The gel pattern, or size pattern, yields a DNA fingerprint that is particular to a combination of the flanking region's polymerase pause sites and its preferential binding sites for the second primer of this method.One of the most significant aspects of UFW is that the method reliably generates data over stretches of DNA that are difficult to sequence or are unsequenceable by conventional methods. UFW also overcomes several drawbacks of earlier genome walking protocols. Previous methods required the use of restriction enzymes, presence of convenient restriction enzyme cleavage sites in the target DNA and use of DNA ligase. The present method is distinguished from earlier methods in that the method is carried out in the absence of a restriction enzyme and of a DNA ligase. The unknown sequence of a target nucleic acid need not contain a restriction enzyme cleavage site, and the method generates sequence information for unknown sequence ranging in size from 0.5-100 kilobases. UFW has several other advantages over known methods. For example, UFW is performed in a single-buffer system, and reagents are directly added to a single buffer mixture in a single vessel such as a test tube or well of a microtiter plate. Volumes are typically in the microliter-scale volumes, but may be scaled up proportionately without sacrificing efficiency or accuracy. UFW is performed with reactions in multitube, multiwell, or microplate arrays, with miniaturization to submicroliter volumes, or with other spatial economizing. An automated or semi-automated system is used to direct the amplification reactions. UFW can be automated using a robotic workstation and a multi-well reaction chamber format."," Therapeutics - Methods  |   Genomics/Proteomics  |   Genomics/Proteomics  |   Therapeutics - Methods","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=1882","Debra Peattie, (617) 495-3067","Harvard University"
"21081","Licensable Technology","A Vitrification System for Improved Post-Thaw Viability of Cells and Tissues","Demirci, Utkan ; Zhang, Xiaohui ; Song, Young Seok; Moon, Sangjun ; Kayaalp, Emre","Technology:
This is a rapid, high-throughput, ejector based vitrification system. This technology has the potential to enable cryostorage of oocytes with high post-thaw viability and has been demonstrated to do so through comparison with fresh oocytes in pathenogenic activation studies. Through minimizing droplet size, ultra-rapid freezing rates are achieved thus allowing for lower concentrations of cryo-preservation agents (CPAs).  Populations that stand to benefit from the commercialization of this technology include: 1.) young female cancer patients that risk losing ovarian function due to explicative surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy, 2.) women who do not have a male partner and do not wish to use a sperm donor to create embryos for storage, and 3.) patients who have ethical, moral, or religious objections to embryo preservation. 

Applications:
Oocyte cryopreservation is a major application for this technology, however there is application for the cryo-storage of blood and all cells.

Advantages:
There are two methods currently in use for oocyte preservation:  1.) slow-freeze/rapid-thaw and 2.) vitrification. The former is prone to hardening of the zona pellicuda and disruption of the chromosomes, leading to a substantial reduction in successful fertilization and in vitro development. The latter while yielding superior post-thaw cell survival can lead to cytoskeletal alterations, chromosomal dispersions and spindle disassembly due to the osmotic shock associated with the relatively high concentrations of CPAs required. Other advantages include: high-throughput, automated, scalable."," Medical Device","http://www.partners.org/techtransfer/availabletechnologies/default.asp","Patrick Bradley, pvbradley@partners.org","Brigham and Women's Hospital"

The first technique involves an in situ passive approach to detection with microphone sensors installed within the blade cavity. Damage to the blade will generate a differential noise component, or aerodynamic energy, that the microphone will detect. The second technique utilizes an active approach involving an audio speaker mounted inside of the blade cavity with a microphone sensor installed outside of the cavity. The internal audio speakers excite the acoustics within the blade while the external microphone senses the acoustic energy. The audio frequency emitted by the speakers is adjustable to be distinguished from the turbine aerodynamic and background noise. The acoustic energy exhibited and sensed by the microphone will be different if there are any cracks or damage in the blade during operation."," Acoustic sensor  |   Turbine blades  |   Acoustic sensor","http://uml.flintbox.com/public/project/28820/","Rajnish Kaushik, Ph.D., Assistant Director, OTC, Umass Lowell, Ph:978-934-4708/978-935-6592, Email: Rajnish_Kaushik@uml.edu","University of Massachusetts Lowell"

Traditional transcutaneous transformers can only transmit energy to the receiver fixed at 1-2 cm beneath the skin. This method can transmit energy to deep-seated or even locomotive implantable devices. A previous method for powering locomotive capsule endoscope required a high voltage (3500 Volts) to excite the transmitting coil and the receiving coil requires an MRI incompatible core. With this technology, the required transmitting coil voltage can be substantially reduced to less than 10 Volts while the transmit power (can be more than 1 Watt) is high enough to operate many implantable devices and the magnetic energy absorption of body tissue is negligible.

Applications: To transmit energy to any kind of implantable devices that require energy to opearate, e.g. spinal cord stimulator, capsule endoscopy, middle ear hearing devices, drug delivery systems, chargers for implantable cardiac pacemakers and artificial hearts.


Advantages: 
Low cost, much safer than traditional method, low voltage

Mass discharge, defined as the contaminant mass per unit time ([M/T]) migrating across a hypothetic control plane orthogonal to the mean groundwater flow, has been widely proposed as a potential metric to assess the impact of partial mass removal in DNAPL source zones. In the field, mass discharge estimates derived from relative sparse observations of contaminant concentration, hydraulic conductivity, and/or mass flux are always subject to uncertainty regardless of the technologies applied. However, the uncertainty is typically not quantified in field applications. An earlier Tufts invention (Tufts Ref. T001444) comprises an algorithm for the quantification of mass discharge uncertainty using multi-level measurements of contaminant concentration and hydraulic conductivity. This algorithm is, to all knowledge, the first one to quantify the uncertainty of mass discharge based on field measurements. Applications of this algorithm on numerically simulated control planes have suggested that one stage sampling design with a regular (rectangular) sampling pattern is not efficient (in terms of sampling density or cost) to accurately model the uncertainty, due to limitations in applying geostatistics to non-representative sample data. Invention:This invention comprises a second algorithm for multi-criteria multi-stage spatial sampling design, which has been developed to optimize the sampling locations and to reduce the required sampling density for an accurate model of uncertainty. The spatial sampling algorithm combines methodologies from a number of disciplines including geostatistics and Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM). It is capable of obtaining representative sample data in terms of the recognition of spatial pattern of contaminant concentration distribution through the identification and delineation of highly concentrated areas (hot spots). Evaluation of this algorithm on hypothetical control planes suggested that the required sampling density can be reduced by at least 50% in comparison with one stage sampling design with a regular sampling pattern. This algorithm is different from other spatial sampling designs in that (1) neither the sampling density nor the sampling pattern is decided a priori; instead, the minimal sampling density is determined by the accuracy of the uncertainty model of mass discharge, and there is no pre-set sampling pattern; (2) more freedom is allowed in the selection of sampling criteria in that there is no requirement that the sample criteria should be mathematically formulated in terms of quantities that can be measured or computed in advance of real sampling; and (3) the weights for sampling criteria are objectively determined and automatically updated by data themselves."," Environment","http://www.tufts.biz/cgi-bin/tech_search.cgi?r=1&case=T001445","Martin Son617-636-3605martin.son@tufts.edu","Tufts University"

"T001472","Licensable Technology","Algorithm to Calculate Particle Size Distributions of Different Particle Shapes from Chord Length Distributions","Christos Georgakis","Tufts University Categories:instrumentation:analyticalAdditional Keywords:(none specified)Invention SummaryThis invention is a computer algorithm, referred hereafter as the Forward Particle Size Distribution Method (FPSDM).  It has been developed to convert Chord Length Distribution (CLD) obtained from the Focus Beam Reflectance Measurement (FBRM) instrument, or other similar analytical equipments, into a Particle Size Distribution (PSD).  The PSD is a critical piece of information needed to control the quality of commercial products either off-line or on-line and in real time in different polymerization, crystallization, or other similar chemical, pharmaceutical, or food processes.  The FPSDM estimates the PSD from the measured CLD very accurately and with very small computational time.  It is different form the existing methods such as regularization  and projection over convex sets (POCS) , which try to invert a rank deficient matrix relating PSD to CLD based on a single given crystal shape.  The advantage of the FPSDM is that it does not need to invert the ill-conditioned conversion matrix.  As a result, the FPSDM provides a PSD estimate that does not have an oscillatory behavior when one is not warranted.  It also avoids altogether the calculation of erroneous negative number of particles for a given size range.  Furthermore, the computation time of the algorithm is less than one minute while the data acquisition time is less than ten seconds.  The algorithm can be easily applied as an add-on calculation to the on-line FBRM measurement.  Instead of following a rigid operating procedure in a given process, such as constant cooling rate of constant supersaturation, the invention enables the use of a vast variety of other operational procedures focused on the characteristics of the particle size distribution.  This could significantly improve the performance of many Pharmaceutical, Chemical, Food, or other related processes."," Instrumentation","http://www.tufts.biz/cgi-bin/tech_search.cgi?r=1&case=T001472","Colm Lawler617-636-0338colm.lawler@tufts.edu","Tufts University"

"01929","Licensable Technology","Alkyl piperidine/piperazine compounds for diagnosis and treatment of CNS disorders","Fischman, Alan ; Choi, Sung-Woon; Shoup, Timothy M.; Elmaleh, David R.","Background:
Dopamingergic neurotransmitter systems are associated with a number of CNS disorders including cocaine dependency and Parkinson's Disease.  Parkinson's Disease results from a severe depletion of the nerve cells that produce dopamine and contain the dopamine transporters (DATs) while cocaine addiction results from the drug's recognition site being located on DATs at a position to block normal dopamine uptake.  Although cocaine can also bind to the serotonin and norepinephrine transporters, the DATs that appear to be the critical recognition sites that provide the reinforcing properties of cocaine use.  There are currently no effective long-term pharmacotherapies that can lessen the abuse of cocaine.
Development of compounds that block the binding sites of dopamine and cocaine on DATs can be used as diagnostic imaging agents with PET and SPECT to follow neurodegeneration of DATs over time and to identify cocaine receptors in the CNS.  In addition, these compounds could be used to assist cocaine addicts in maintaining abstinence.

Application:  
Specific imaging agents and therapeutic compounds for dopaminergic transporters.

Technology:
The present invention is the discovery that bisarylmethoxybutyl-piperazine/piperdine derivatives have high affinity (nM concentrations) and selectivity for DATs.  Novel piperazine compounds have been synthesized and used to image DATs in the CNS.  Upon binding to the DATs, these compounds can act as either functional therapeutic agonists or antagonists whereas some derivatives have been shown to prevent the binding of cocaine to the DAT without significant inhibition of dopamine uptake whereas other derivatives can inhibit dopamine uptake (at concentrations comparable or lower than that reported for cocaine).  Furthermore, some of the analogs demonstrated selective serotonin and/or norepinephrine transporter binding activities, and thus, may prove useful for the treatment of other neurological disorders upon further investigation (e.g. ADHD, Parkinson's, stroke, depression).

The strong confinement and high Kerr response in the material used combined with low multi-photon absorption lead to excellent optical properties and the ability to build highly efficient, ultrafast nonlinear devices. All-optical logic devices operating with low energy thresholds across several communications bands can be constructed. The material’s bandgap provides transparency throughout the visible spectrum and ultrafast all-optical capabilities for wavelengths greater than 800 nm. It has a high nonlinear refractive index that is 30 times silica, with vanishing two-photon absorption around 800 nm. It also has a high linear refractive index of ~2.4, enabling dense on-chip integration of nanophotonic waveguides, adaptable waveguide dispersion and high confinement.  This high confinement produces effective nonlinearities up to 100,000 times that found in standard silica fiber. Further the material can be deposited directly on silicon chips then structure devices using conventional fabrication procedures. In addition, the material is inexpensive, abundant, and nontoxic making for an ideal platform to create miniature devices for all-optical processing."," Networking/Communications  |   Photonics/Optical Systems  |   Networking/Communications  |   Photonics/Optical Systems","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3132","Alan Gordon, (617) 384-5000","Harvard University"

This strategy favors the preservation of the native conformation of the antigen. This novel technology was tested using a highly repetitive chain of recombinant antigen (peptide homopolymers derived from HIV-1 gp120) bound to the nanoparticles by a method that will not allow the antigen to readily dissociate. (Bioconjugate Chemistry. 1997, V. 8, N. 3, pg. 424-433) The size of this complex is ideal for phagocytosis by antigen presenting cells.  The antigen-nanoparticle complexes induced the highest peptide-specific serum antibody responses as compared to a hydrophilic adjuvant given with the antigen or the antigen alone.  Moreover, these antibodies showed the strongest reactivity towards recombinant, glycosylated gp120 and HIV-1 infected T cells.  This novel vaccine approach may be useful for induction of immune responses against conformation-sensitive viral antigens without the need for additional adjuvants."," Research Tools  |   Therapeutics - Drugs","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=642","Meyer, Abbie, abbie.meyer@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"

This method can be used to construct new catalytic nanoparticles having a very large surface area/weight ratio leading to increased production and high yields.  Using Aluminum (Al), instead of the more expensive silver (Ag) and palladium (Pd) templates, has advantages as it can form alloys with many other metals such as nickel and titanium with vigorous heat production when ignited. Further, the oxide layer formed on Al surface can protect the Al metal from uncontrolled side reactions. In this study, fabrication of aluminum-nickel (Al-Ni) core-shell nanoparticles and porous Ni nano-shell particles through sacrificing Al nanoparticle templates were achieved. This means greater catalytic performance for the same material, or a lower cost catalyst may be substituted without reducing performance.

The inventor has developed a novel system for delivery of inhaled anesthetics which enables a completely automated method for safe and effective administration of closed circuit anesthesia.  

Although the low flow, closed circuit methods of administering Inhaled general anesthetic agents are more efficient than the more widely used high flow, open circuit technique, currently available anesthesia delivery technologies make it difficult for most anesthesiologists to easily and confidently manage the complex pharmacodynamics and gas kinetics required to effectively manage closed circuit administration.  

This new automatic closed-circuit delivery method implements a physiological model of the patients uptake and response to anesthetic gas, and includes a novel algorithm that allows the anesthesiologist to specify the desired concentration in a physiological compartment.  The system then assumes control of the fresh gas flow and vaporizer settings such as to produce the optimum blend of dynamic clinical response and efficient gas usage.  

Application:	  
This technology can be implemented in a general anesthesia delivery system, and used both clinically and in medical training.
 
Advantages:   
-	Allows anesthesiologists to easily, safely and confidently utilize closed circuit anesthesia. 
-	Significant reduction in the amount of anesthetic agent required, minimizing exposure of the patient to anesthetic agents and reducing potential for unwanted side effects.
-	Reduces the cost of administration of anesthesia by lowering volume of agent used.
-	Enables increased use of anesthetic agents such as desflurane and xenon, which despite clear benefits, can be cost prohibitive when used in high flow, open circuit conditions."," Software  |   Medical Device","http://www.partners.org/techtransfer/availabletechnologies/default.asp","Grace Leung, gsleung@partners.org, 617-954-9327","Brigham and Women's Hospital"

In many cases, individuals suffering from these disorders can exhibit altered patterns of speech. Human speech comprises content and prosody.  Content of speech includes the information given by the words and sentences, while prosody adds valuable information to the content of speech by varying the rhythm, stress, and intonation of speech.  Speech prosody can be analyzed from recorded or live speech, to analyze the speech data in view of features of the underlying prosody. The speech data can be characterized by various parameters that include, for example, the fundamental frequency of the acoustic signal (pitch), the amplitude of the signal (intensity/loudness), and the temporal behavior of the signal, i.e., the time periods during which the acoustic signal is present (utterance or syllable) and the time periods without any acoustic signal (pause). The invention is based on the discovery that a representation of speech data from different sources can be distinguished by separating the speech data into utterances and pauses according to one or more specific rules.
     Potential Commercial Uses: The invention features methods of diagnosing psychiatric disorders by analyzing the prosody of speech in a patient. Using specific rules developed by the inventors, a patient's speech can be analyzed in a recording or other reproduction of live speech, in order to detect specific patterns that are characteristic of disorders such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.

The product is an antisense inhibitor that increases levels of HDL (good cholesterol). This improves the ratio of good (HDL) to bad (LDL) cholesterol. The inhibitor increases the level of good cholesterol by (i) preferential conversion of intracellular bad cholesterol into good cholesterol and (ii) potentially being able to reverse the already formed bad cholesterol into good cholesterol. Both of these mechanisms improve the ratio of good/bad cholesterol and decrease the risk of a patient developing cardiovascular disease. 

The inhibitor product could also be a shRNA or siRNA nucleotide rather than an antisense neuclotide.

Application:
The primary application for this invention is a therapeutic for patients at risk of developing atherosclerotic plaques.

Advantages:
- Significant prevalence rate
- Growing public awareness
- Emerging markets (India and China)
- High specificity allows to easily identify responders

"03131","Licensable Technology","Anthrapyrazolone Inhibitors for the Treatment of Cancer","Teixeira, Jose ; Donahoe, Patricia K.","Technology:
The Mullerian inhibiting substance, (MIS), also known as Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) is a protein hormone structurally related to inhibin and activin, and a member of the transforming growth factor-? (TGF-?) family. AMH is a dimeric glycoprotein that acts by activating the MIS type II receptor (MISRII). Its intended function is to inhibit the development of the Mullerian ducts in the male embryo. MIS has also been shown to inhibit the proliferation of ovarian, prostate, breast, and cervical cancer cells.  It has been challenging, however, to produce active protein in quantities needed for research or clinical use. Investigators at Massachusetts General Hospital have determined that the anthrapyrazolone inhibitor class of compounds can activate the MIS type II receptor and produce anti-cancer MIS like effects.  The small molecule inhibitors act specifically on the MIS type II receptor and not on the other receptors of the TGF? family.  

Application:
Treatment of ovarian, prostate, breast, and cervical cancer with a small molecule inhibitor of MIS type II receptor.

Advantages:
1)	Unlike MIS protein, this  compound class can be easily synthesized using known  chemical synthetic methods
2)	Anthrapyrazolone inhibitors (such as CC401,Celgene) have successfully reached clinical stage trials. (Phase I)
3)	The MIS type II receptor is expressed by ovarian, breast and prostate cancers, and has been shown to be responsive to MIS, suggesting that this class of compounds may be effective in these cancers.

The insufficient migration of immune cells or a weak immune reaction to cancerous cells or infections may lead to disease. Tumor cell metastasis or endothelial cell migration to a tumor site may be inhibited by local application of anti-fugetactic agents. This leads to site-specific enhancement of immune responses immediately surrounding a tumor, or at infection sites. Anti-fugetactic polypeptides include certain cytokine binding agents, anti-cytokine antibodies or a cytokine agonist that modulate activity. For example, these may be a CXCR4 antagonist, CXCR3 antagonist, CXCR4/SDF-1 antagonist or a selective PKC inhibitor such as thalidomide.  The CXCR4 antagonist may consist of AMD3100, KRH-1636, T-20, 1-22, 1-140, TE-1401 1, T-14012, TN14003.
Applications: 
- These agents may be used to treat solid tumors and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, Crohn's disease, thyroiditis, glomerulonephritis, autoimmune hepatitis. 
- Treatment may be in combination with anti-inflammatory agents that inhibit migration of immune cells to sites of inflammation, such as abscesses, transplants or implants.

Advantages:
Localized use of anti-fugetactic agents, for example by administration around tumor sites,  avoids the side-effects of systemic treatment.

"21638","Licensable Technology","Anti-miRNA 425 for the Treatment of Hypertension & Heart Failure","Wang, Thomas J; Bloch, Kenneth D.; Newton-Cheh, Christopher ; Arora, Pankaj","Technology:
Investigators in the Cardiovascular Research Center at MGH have identified a microRNA, miR-425, as a novel regulator of ANP production, raising the possibility that miR-425 antagonists (anti-miR-425) could be used to treat disorders of salt overload, including hypertension and heart failure. ANP levels have been shown to be inversely associated with hypertension, therefore inhibiting the microRNA-mediated destruction of ANP could be a useful therapeutic strategy for hypertension.

The inventors have shown that miR-425 is expressed in the atria and ventricles of the human heart.  miR-425 is predicted to bind the sequence spanning the SNP rs5068 for the A, but not the G, allele, thus targeting the major allele which is present in ~92% of patients. miR-425 silenced natriuretic peptide precursor A (NPPA) mRNA in an allele-specific manner, with the G allele conferring resistance to miR-425. Augmenting ANP production would be expected to enhance the patient?s ability to respond to intermittent increases in atrial stretch, potentially avoiding the adverse effects associated with continuous infusion of natriuretic peptides.  

Applications:
-	A companion molecular diagnostic for the rs5068 variant, which will inform clinicians about a patient's responsiveness to anti-microRNA treatment for hypertension. 
-	Anti-miR 425 as a therapeutic agent to treat hypertension patients bearing the rs5068 major allele in the 3'UTR of ANP.
-	Combination therapy for hypertension for example with neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitors and anti-miR425. NEP is an enzyme that degrades ANP, thus blocking NEP is another method to treat hypertension.

Advantages:
-	Targeted therapy for hypertension, especially for anti-hypertensive refractory patients, in people bearing the major allele of rs5068. 
-	Reduced side-effects of anti-microRNA treatment, due to specificity of action. 
-	Opportunity to introduce a patent-protected therapy for hypertension, in a market that is dominated by generics. SC administration of anti-miR-425 (likely once a week) could improve the compliance dramatically (currently 2/3rd of hypertensive individuals are non-compliant, per JNC VII).
-	Possible combination therapy using anti-miR-425 with NEP inhibitors (FDA approved or next generation) to increase ANP levels.

The scavenger receptors (SRs) expressed by macrophages are thought to play an important role in the immune response against bacteria by mediating binding and phagocytosis. An important family of receptors involved in these processes are the class A macrophage scavenger receptors (SRA). There are three classes of SRs, namely A, B and C. SR-A, type I and type II, are homotrimeric glycoproteins composed of three 77 kD monomers. MARCO is a member of this class A of scavenger receptors. The molecular structure of MARCO resembles that of SR-AI, containing a triple-helical collagenous domain and a scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domain at the C terminus. MARCO is expressed by distinct populations of macrophages in the spleen and lymph nodes. It is rapidly induced on macrophages in other tissues (e.g. liver Kupfer cells) during infection or LPS treatment. MARCO seems to play an important role in the lungs response to inhaled particles and airborne pathogens.

The antibodies are used extensively in basic biomedical research,diagnostics and treatment of various illnesses such as infections and cancer. The present methods of purifying antibodies all require chromatography, which is laborintensive, requires expensive materials and is also operationally demanding at large scales. This has led the industry to constantly look for innovative ways to reduce the manufacturing and purification costs of antibodies. Another high priority has been to increase the purity because higher doses require lower contaminant levels. The invention describes a method for purifying bivalent antibodies made at large scale.The commercial application of the technology is primarily to significantly reduce the costof purifying and generating bivalent antibodies of very high concentration.The market for therapeutic monoclonal antibodies has experienced significant growth inrecent years. The global market is projected to increase to US $16.7 billion with a compound annual growth rate of about 20 % from 2002 (Nature reviews V. 3 May 2004). High concentrations of bivalent antibodies do not only facilitate further research on antibodies as such but might also, as a result of the increased affinity, be important in treatment of various illnesses like cancer.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:The method purifies antibodies or antibody fragments that are active at both Fab sites from a source of antibodies or antibody fragments using a non-chromatographic method that includes the formation and isolation of discrete cyclic aggregates of antibodies.

"CCMC   1658","Licensable Technology","Antibody to detect 2ME2 in bodily fluids","Folkman, M. J.","2-Methoxyestradiol (2ME2) is a natural metabolite of estrogen with little or no estrogenic activity that is only present at high concentrations physiologically during pregnancy.  The molecule is a potent angiogenesis inhibitor and based on this activity, it was tested as a novel therapy for the treatment of cancer. Most recently 2ME2 has been investigated as a potential treatment for preeclampsia, inflammatory disorders, diabetes, and pulmonary hypertension. Despite the study of 2ME2 and its long history in clinical trials, there is currently no assay to precisely and rapidly determine levels of 2ME2 in bodily fluids.||

Dr. Barnes and her colleagues have developed the reagents necessary to precisely and rapidly determine levels of 2ME2 in bodily fluids through an immune-based assay. The key reagent developed is a polyclonal antibody that is specific to 2ME2 and sensitive enough to detect very low levels. The group also generated a number of key derivatives of 2ME2 needed to generate an antibody that would be specific for 2ME2 and not other closely related molecules."," Research Tools  |   Research Reagents","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=1658","Dietz, Ryan, ryan.dietz@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"
"JDP-032","Licensable Technology","Antigen Associated With Type I Diabetes Mellitus","Massimo Pietropaolo, M.D., Ph.D.","This invention relates to a protein, designated PM-1, that is expressed in human pancreatic islet cells. Autoantibodies to this protein have been found in serum of some prediabetic individuals who later developed diabetes, while such autoantibodies have not been found in serum of nondiabetic individuals. This evidence suggests that these autoantibodies are correlated to the development of diabetes, and possibly to a predisposition to the disease. This leads to possible strategies for therapeutic approaches to diabetes as well as diagnostic methods for predisposition to diabetes. Purified PM-1 protein can be used as a therapeutic to treat or prevent the development of Type I diabetes. By administering this protein, or an antigenic fragment thereof, to a patient having diabetes or at risk of developing diabetes, the immune response to the PM-1 protein can be blocked. Issued U.S. Patent Number 5,891,437 covers this strategy. Alternatively, the PM-1 protein can be used in diagnostic assays to detect the presence of the PM-1 autoantibodies, to determine if a person is at risk of, or has a predisposition for, developing diabetes.

A transducer measures the vibration of the housing of an MOV. The vibrations are due to the motions of the rotating elements within the housing, which motions are directly related to the motion of the valve relative to its seat. Signal processing apparatus analyzes the vibrations to recover the rotations of the rotating elements and thus the motion of the valve plug. Lost motion can also be determined (if a lost motion connection exists) by demodulating the vibration signal and thus taking into account also the lost motion. Simultaneously, the forces applied to the valve are estimated by estimating the torque between the stator and the rotor of the motor. Such torque can be estimated from measuring the input current and voltage alone, using a forgetting factor and a correction for the forgetting factor. A signature derived from relating the torque to the valve position can be used to assess the condition of the MOV, by comparing the signature to signatures for MOVs of known conditions. The vibration analysis components generate signals that relate to the position of elements in the operator. Similarly, the torque estimator estimates the torque output by any type of electric motor, whether or not part of an MOV analysis unit."," ","http://www.ipvisioninc.com/findurl.php?uid=mitDossier:6368","Jack Turner","Massachusetts Institute of Technology"

The techniques are non-invasive and comprise safe levels of optical radiation.BackgroundOptical techniques offer a safe, non-invasive way to study human tissue.  Tissue images are created by emphasizing contrasts in light absorption on the near infrared spectrum (NIR) by hemoglobin.  The art is well-established and commonly used to detect breast lesions.Oxygenation levels of tissue may be used to determine whether a lesion is malignant or benign.  Oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin show different absorption spectra in the red and infrared bands.  Malignant tumors often feature hypoxic or anoxic conditions allowing for easy differentiation of benign tumors.Advantages and ApplicationsThe advantages of the available technology are many.  The described optical techniques enhance image contrast to facilitate detection of tumors and lesions.  Used in conjunction with improved oximetry techniques developed by our researchers, it is significantly easier to differentiate benign and malignant tumors.  The systems can be implemented using known equipment.One aspect of the invention involves spatial second derivatives to discriminate between benign and malignant tumors.  The derivatives enhance differentiation of regions having different levels of light absorption, which is a function of concentration and oxygenation levels.  A primary advantage of this approach is that it is not limited by the size, shape and depth of the region within the sample.  The optical imaging systems have immediate applications in assessing all optically accessible human tissues including the brain, breasts and muscle tissue.  A very important application for the systems and techniques is the improved diagnostic capability of optical mammography.  The systems and methods can be applied to identify tumors regardless of their shape, size, or depth of the tumor within the breast.  Early and accurate detection of breast cancer dramatically improves treatment options, reduces the need for invasive surgery and generally enhances odds of survival.  The described oximetry techniques may also be used to investigate other hemoglobin-rich localized tissue areas such as selected cerebral areas, hematoma and large blood vessels."," Diagnostics/Biomarkers  |   Medical Devices","http://www.tufts.biz/cgi-bin/tech_search.cgi?r=1&case=T001165","Colm Lawler617-636-0338colm.lawler@tufts.edu","Tufts University"

The single crystal has a crystal lattice that is continuous and unbroken to the edges of the crystal, with minimal defects such as impurities or grain boundaries.  In comparison, a polycrystalline solid includes a number of smaller crystals or crystallites separated by grain boundaries, and an amorphous solid has limited or no ordering of atoms, ions or molecules.Certain single crystals are of interest to both academia and industry and have important applications.  For example, single crystals of silicon and other semiconductors are used to manufacture integrated circuits, single crystals of sapphire and other materials are used for lasers and nonlinear optics, single crystals of fluorite are sometimes used in objective lenses of refracting telescopes, and single crystals of metals (such as superalloys) are used in some gas turbines.  Furthermore, a single crystal of a material allows the atomic structure of the material to be determined (e.g., using X-ray diffraction), which otherwise would be difficult or impossible to determine.  A single crystal of a material also allows the physical and chemical properties of the material to be characterized free of any influence from defects and along a selected direction.  Some defects, such as grain boundaries, dislocations and impurities, can have significant effects on the physical, mechanical, and/or chemical properties of a material.Invention:This invention provides for apparatuses and methods for growing single crystals, such as, for example, single crystals of ice.

CDF9, a glycosylphosphatidylinostitol (CPI)-linked membrane protein is a  key inhibitor for restricting the formation of the membrane attack complex of complement (MAC) by binding to complement proteins C8 and C9 and preventing C9 incorporation and polymerization.  Complement is a main mediator for acquired immune (antibody) mediated response to kill foreign pathogens, such as viruses and parasites.   ILY specifically binds human erythrocytes and lyses only cells that express hCD59 through binding to the hCD59 C8 and c9 binding site.  Specifically, the a particular domain of ILY contains a critical binding site for hCD59.  Therefore, this domain of ILY and complement proteins C8 and C9 recognize the same or overlapping regions of hCD59.  Indeed, the small peptides derived from this domain of ILY inhibit the human cd59 function.  Based on these results, we propose that the modified peptide derived from a domain ILY can be applied for blocking hCD59 function to enhance complement mediated immune reaction to foreign pathogens for the treatment and prevention of foreign pathogens such as virus and parasite infection."," Therapeutics - Drugs","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=2937","Michal Preminger, (617) 432-0920","Harvard University"

"UMD 08-12","Licensable Technology","Approximate SRT Division Method","Makia Powell","A critical feature of most encryption systems is the ability to perform division on very large numbers. However, performing division functions digitally on most microprocessors is much more difficult and resource hungry than performing addition, subtraction and multiplication. Existing algorithms for digital division fall into two main categories: slow division and fast division. Slow division algorithms produce one digit of the final quotient per iteration. Fast division methods start with a close approximation to the final quotient and produce twice as many digits of the final quotient on each iteration. One popular slow division method is known as SRT division, named from the Sweeny, Robertson, and Tocher algorithm. The present invention is an improvement on the SRT method, referred to as “Partial SRT”. It depends on the fact that if any two numbers are known out to their first N digits, then the first N-1 digits of their product or division will be known. The algorithm allows the calculation of a speculative approximation, rounded up only to a certain decimal place, which can be corrected later in an iterative process. Use of the algorithm exponentially reduces the number of entries in the Quotient Table, resulting in significant advantages in terms of cost, speed and improved operation. This invention would be of interest to microprocessor manufacturers as well as chip or hardware makers.

"JDP-107","Licensable Technology","ARNT2: A Novel Target for Diabetes","Ronald Kahn, M.D. et al.","The invention is based on the discovery of new targets not previously known to be linked to diabetes. Microarray analysis of human pancreatic islets from people with Type 2 diabetes compared to controls with normal glucose tolerance showed that the transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon nuclear receptor translocator (ARNT) was down-regulated in the diabetic individuals. This factor was expressed in all of the control individuals but expression was not detected in microarray analysis of samples from any of the diabetic subjects, and beta-cell specific knockout mice lacking the ARNT gene developed beta cell dysfunction and diabetes. Because ARNT is known to act as a heterodimer, the inventors then investigated the role of potential partners for ARNT, and discovered that the transcription factor ARNT2 (homologous to ARNT but expressed from a different gene) also has an effect, but an opposite one, on glucose metabolism. Knocking down ARNT2 expression using RNAi resulted in significantly increased glucose stimulated insulin secretion, and decreased ARNT2 expression was accompanied by increased expression of genes known to be involved in glucose metabolism. It therefore appears that inhibition of ARNT2 would be desirable to alleviate the symptoms of diabetes, while enhancement of ARNT function would be desirable for the same purpose. Salsalate or other nonacetylated salicylates can be used as a novel treatment for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, and to treat or prevent CV disease. The salicylates, and salsalate in particular, have been used for decades in human therapeutics, and are known to have very favorable human safety profiles. The inventors’ proof-of-principle clinical studies have shown that salsalate, in safe and tolerable doses, reduces glycemia, improves lipid homeostatis, and may improve inflammatory cardiovascular risk indexes in overweight individuals. More extensive clinical trials are now underway, which could provide support for ultimate FDA approval for such therapies."," Genomics/Proteomics  |   Genomics/Proteomics  |   Genomics/Proteomics","http://www.joslinresearch.org/inventions","David J.

"CCMC   2102","Licensable Technology","Assay for single molecule measurements of reversible receptor-ligand bond interactions","Springer, Timothy","Dr. Springer has developed novel methods and an assay for single molecule measurements of reversible receptor-ligand bond interactions. This assay is also applicable for the interaction between a receptor portion and a ligand portion wherein the receptor portion and the ligand portion are in separate polypeptides and not on a single chimeric polypeptide.||

Dr. Springer's lab has found that by using a single chimeric fusion polypeptide that comprise a receptor portion and a ligand portion within a single polypeptide, wherein the receptor portion and the ligand portion are in close proximity, binding between the receptor portion and ligand portion occurs. Using an optical tweezer to pull the two ends of a chimeric polypeptide in opposite directions, strain is applied to the interaction between the receptor and its ligand in the chimeric polypeptide. The inventors were then able to study the minute external forces needed to stretch out the fusion polypeptide such that the interaction between the receptor portion and ligand portion is overcome by the external force applied. Also, the inventors were able to study the effects of receptor agonist/activator or antagonist/inhibitor on the external forces needed to disrupt the interaction between the receptor portion and ligand portion in the chimeric polypeptide. Other parameters useful for identifying agonist/activator or antagonist/inhibitor includes the changes in the dissociation and association rate constants for the interaction between a receptor portion and a ligand portion. ||

The novel methods and assay form a powerful way to study binding interactions between two entities and methods for screening of modulators of protein-protein interactions, in particular, receptor-ligand interactions. The dissociation and association of two proteins or binding portions, and the related dissociation and association rate constants can be studied by the methods."," Research Tools","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=2102","Dietz, Ryan, ryan.dietz@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"

Quantum dots (QD) are tiny crystals that emit rich colorful light when stimulated by an electric current. These next-generation LEDs provide excellent spectral purity, wide-range tunability and the potential for improved efficiency.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:A team of Harvard engineers led by Prof. Narayanamurti has devised a new device architecture based on a monolayer of quantum dots sandwiched between two inorganic conducting layers. Taking advantage of the surface chemistry of the quantum dots, atomic layer deposition (ALD) is used to deposit an ultra-thin layer of aluminum oxide to isolate individual quantum dots (see figure), thus effectively reducing inter-dot coupling. When the tunneling current passes through the quantum dots, each dot lights up like a light bulb, and their sum gives the total light intensity of the device. The advantages of this new device architecture are threefold. First, the usage of a single quantum dot layer pushes the material cost to be minimal. Second, due to reduced inter-dot coupling, this architecture has the potential to further improve device efficiency. Third, the new architecture allows high-current density, which could be promising for the realization of high-brightness devices or lasers. Looking beyond the obvious applications in lighting and displays, this new technology has potential applications in field-effect transistors, flash memory chips and solar cells.The Al2O3 layer deposited by ALD isolates individual quantum dots, allowinghigh-density current to pass through the dots only.

The inventors have developed an automated metabolite analysis system that employs column-switching high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and different modes of analytical detection, including LC-MS and radioactivity detectors. Currently, all column-switching HPLC is performed manually or via a ""home-grown"" system. The automated column-switching HPLC system simplifies and accelerates the HPLC process and offers improved consistency and reproducibility over manual processes.

Application:
Column-switching HPLC is used to separate a mixture of components in a body fluid sample, e.g. a blood or urine sample, for identification, analysis, or purification of the components. The automated column-switching HPLC system can be used for radiometabolite analysis, in which plasma is filtered from whole blood and analyzed to detect the presence and quality of radioactive metabolites using a downstream radioactivity detector. The automated HPLC system is capable of rapid separation of plasma from whole blood and rapid computer-controlled flow through the system, allowing radioactive metabolites with short half-lives to be detected by downstream detectors.

Advantages:
- Automatic control by a computer system significantly increases throughput and sample-to-sample consistency and significantly decreases the occurrence of errors.
- Rapid separation of plasma from whole blood and rapid, computer-controlled flow through the system allows radioactive metabolites with short half-lives to be detected before they have significantly decayed. 
- Components are integrated as a single unit, simplifying setup and use of the systems and eliminating the need for an operator to build and maintain a custom system."," Diagnostic  |   Research Tool/Screening Tool","http://www.partners.org/techtransfer/availabletechnologies/default.asp","Rebecca Listfield, rlistfield@partners.org, 617-954-9387","Massachusetts General Hospital"

The present invention provides a cost effective method of producing auxetic knit structures from readily available filaments by employing geometrically engineered structures and novel design configurations. Specifically, the inventors have developed novel designs and methods of inserting the fillet and in-lay filaments in the knit structures. The auxetic fabrics of the invention become fatter when deformed because of the geometrical and design improvements engineered in the structures. Desired fabric features can be achieved by choice of the specific material to be used.

"4406","Licensable Technology","Bacteria based PrP and Amyloid technology generates novel aggregation assays","Hochschild, Ann","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Abnormal aggregation and accumulation of amyloid-forming proteins can lead to a variety of protein aggregation disorders known as amyloidoses, including type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s (AD), Parkinson’s (PD), Huntington’s (HD) and prion diseases. To date the mechanistic basis of prion-mediated cytotoxicity remains poorly understood. Despite 40 years of intensive scientific attention, no effective treatments have been developed for controlling mammalian prion diseases. Underlying these inevitably fatal neurodegenerative diseases is the specific cellular protein PrP, which has the potential to form self-propagating aggregates that are infectious. These aggregates are composed of highly structured sheet-rich fibrils known as amyloids, and conversion to the fibrillar form (PrPres) involves a specific change in the conformation of PrP. Two important factors continue to hinder the development of therapeutics for Prion disease: 1. The mechanistic basis of prion-mediated cytotoxicity remains poorly understood. Although the majority of studies aimed at uncovering therapeutics for prion disease have targeted PrPres, an increasing body of evidence points to pre-fibrillar aggregates of PrP as the most toxic species, suggesting that it may be critical to target the earliest steps in the conversion of soluble PrP to PrPres. 2.  Whereas many amyloidogenic proteins readily undergo conversion to the Amyloid form in vitro, the de novo conversion of purified recombinant PrP to the infectious, aggregated form has been accomplished only with great difficulty. Soluble PrP must typically be treated with denaturants to promote protein misfolding and subjected to multiple cycles of sonication and incubation (a procedure called Protein Misfolding Cyclic Amplification, or PMCA) in the presence of facilitating factors to amplify the aggregated form. The requirement for these cumbersome manipulations complicates efforts to study the misfolding events or the intermediate oligomeric species generated during PrP aggregation. To circumvent some of these difficulties, alternative Amyloid-forming proteins are being explored as surrogate systems for the discovery of therapeutics for controlling prion diseases. The Hochschild lab proposed to implement an E. coli-based assay to identify small molecules that could modulate the intracellular aggregation of a bacterial Amyloid-forming protein. The lab had since developed a new E. coli-based assay that facilitates the efficient fibrillization of a variety of amyloidogenic proteins at the cell surface. This assay provides a new experimental approach for studying PrP.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Scientists at the Hochschild lab have directly exploited the ability of E. coli cells to assemble Amyloid fibers at the cell surface to develop a general assay for identifying amyloidogenic proteins. The de novo conversion of purified recombinant PrP to the infectious, aggregated form has been accomplished only recently and using a lengthy and cumbersome procedure. The proposed E. coli-based system has the potential to provide a greatly simplified means to study the PrP conversion process and the effects of facilitating factors and other prospective modulators of PrP conversion and aggregation.This technology could be utilized for two different assays: 1. A cell growth assay to screen small molecules that can modulate the intracellular aggregation of a bacterial Amyloid-forming protein.This technology can be adapted for high-throughput screens to detect small molecules that can disrupt the assembly and/or promote the clearance of the toxic aggregates. 2. An assay for monitoring the abilities of specific target proteins to form Amyloid aggregates.This could serve as a platform for the mass production of research tools to study conversion processes of specific Amyloid-forming proteins and the effects of modulators of Amyloid conversion and aggregation. This assay may also be adapted to a sensitive method to detect infectious materials. This technology makes it possible to study or identify compounds that target the intermediate process towards Amyloid aggregation including the initial formation of soluble oligomers. Finally, it is fast, inexpensive, and highly reproducible. The technology is highly versatile and can be used to study a broad range of Amyloid-forming protein and their derivatives."," Research Tools","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=4406","Michal Preminger, (617) 432-0920","Harvard University"
"CCMC   960","Licensable Technology","Bacterial Ion Channel, a Platform for Screening Ion Channel Agonists and Antagonists","Clapham, David","The pore-forming subunits of canonical voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels are encoded by four repeated domains of 6 transmembrane spanning (6TM) segments.  Investigators at Children's Hospital expressed and characterized a bacterial ion channel from Bacillus halodurans that is encoded by one 6TM segment.  The pore region of the novel channel is homologous to that of voltage-gated calcium channels.  In addition, the expressed channel is activated by voltage, and is blocked by calcium channel blockers.  Despite this resemblance to Cav channels, the novel channel is selective for sodium.  This novel protein represents the first bacterial voltage-sensitive ion-selective channel, as well as the first functionally expressed Cav or Nav composed of only 6 transmembrane domains.

We anticipate this bacterial protein could be used as a platform technology for the high level expression of mammalian ion channel pore domains in mammalian or bacterial cells.  The idea is to insert the pore region of known mammalian ion channels into this minimal bacterial structure.  The hybrid proteins could then be screened for activation or inhibition by various compounds. The advantages of this system would include:
-A minimal length structure that is highly expressed in mammalian cells.
-The expressed bacterial ion channel is functionally active in a heterologous cell system."," Research Tools  |   Drug Discovery Tools","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=960","Miracco, Amy, amy.rasson@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"

Sonenshein, David W.K. Acheson and Gerald T. KeuschBackground:One obstacle to universal immunization may be the lack of heat stability of many vaccines.  Vaccines that are not stored in the required temperature may break down resulting in the inability to induce specific protective responses.  It is often difficult and expensive to provide and maintain an adequate cold chain from manufacturer to the final user, especially in third world countries.Researchers at Tufts University and New England Medical Center have developed a method of inducing a vertebrate animal to produce an immune response to a model vaccine antigen by genetically engineering a spore-forming bacterial cell to express the antigen after oral administration.  Using bacterial spores offers a simple solution to vaccine antigen delivery.  It allows ambient temperature vaccine storage in any climate and oral administration that is both easy and safe.  This type of vaccine will be simple and inexpensive to produce and will have a prolonged shelf life.Status: U.S. Patent No. 5,800,821 issued September 1, 1998Opportunity: This technology is available for licensing and sponsored research."," Vaccines","http://www.tufts.biz/cgi-bin/tech_search.cgi?r=1&case=T000995","John Cosmopoulos617-636-0366john.cosmopoulos@tufts.edu","Tufts University"
"596","Licensable Technology","BAL, a Novel Risk-Related Gene","Shipp, M","The mechanism of infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) includes binding of the HIV exterior envelope glycoprotein gp120 to the CD4 receptor of certain immune cells.  Researchers have identified sites on the gp120 envelope protein that significantly affect its ability to bind CD4; blocking these sites can drastically limit the ability of gp120 to bind CD4.  Accordingly, this technology features immunogenic peptides having specified epitopes that are in turn used to generate antibodies.  These antibodies bind to corresponding epitopes of the gp120 protein that are important for the interaction with CD4 receptors.

Applications/Advantages: The immunogenic peptides featured by this technology can be used for immunoprophylaxis or immunotherapy.  Administration of these peptides to a healthy individual will result in antibodies against the binding sites of gp120, granting protection against future HIV infection.  In an infected individual, subsequent antibodies (which differ from antibodies against complete gp120) can help prevent or delay further infection.  Preferably, one may use combinations of peptides corresponding to the different epitopes to elicit a series of antibodies.  Alternatively, the antibodies of the invention may be directly administered to the patient.  These antibodies may be used to deliver a desired moiety such as a cytotoxic drug or an enzyme that will specifically cleave gp120 (and thus delete the binding site).  Last, these antibodies are useful in immunoassays to detect the presence of gp120 and therefore HIV.

Applications/Advantages: The International Prognostic Index, a risk factor model based upon clinical features and observations, is currently used to partition DLB-CL patients into risk categories. In contrast, this invention provides a molecular basis for the differences in clinical outcome-BAL. This technology provides both the BAL gene and protein, and methods for BAL expression, detection and modulation. For example, the anti-BAL antibodies of the invention can be used to detect and isolate BAL proteins, regulate the bioavailability of BAL proteins, and modulate BAL activity. Likewise, this invention provides nucleic acid fragments suitable as primers or hybridization probes for the detection of BAL-encoding nucleic acid. These detection schemes may be used either as diagnostic or prognostic assays to identify patients having or at risk of developing aggressive DLB-CL; the clinician can use this knowledge to tailor-fit an appropriate therapeutic regimen or prophylactic approach."," Therapeutics - Methods","http://www.dfci.harvard.edu/res/technology/available.asp?case_number=596&keywords=&category_id=4&category_name=Targets+and+Screens","Elena Moir, Phone (617) 632-4018, Fax (617) 632-4012, Email elena_moir@dfci.harvard.edu","Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"
"BH-005","Licensable Technology","Balloon Endoscope Device","Jerry Khachi, M.D.","The invention is an improved tool for endoscopic surgery that provides the surgeon with greater maneuverability and powerful dissection capabilities, particularly useful for surgeries involving small incisions. The device is an endoscope shaft that includes a number of separately inflatable balloon chambers that alone or together with exterior functional channels (e.g., instrument channels, air channels, water channels) circumferentially surround the end of the shaft. This novel configuration of inflatable balloons enables the endoscope to be manipulated in more powerful ways than is currently possible. The device is smaller than conventional endoscopes, and has the ability to safely dissect tissue planes, regardless of the location--subcutaneous, subfascial, intraperitoneal, intrathoracic and intracranial-- while allowing the planes to be directly visualized in a video image. Using the instrument channels, the device also has the capability to apply clips, irrigate, suction and to cut vessels in small and inaccessible areas. For most proposed uses, its small diameter and maneuverability allows for near incision-less and potentially scar-free procedures. Although sharing features with other endoscopic devices, this invention is expected to have broader capabilities than other devices now on the market. This device would allow maneuverability that other devices do not provide, particularly for surgery involving small incisions, and may also allow certain endoscopic surgeries to be performed without distending the area to be operated on, which in some cases may avoid the need for general anesthesia. Its applications are varied and include the following: in thoracic surgery, use of this device will avoid the need to deflate and stop ventilation to the side of the lung one is operating on; in abdominal cavity surgeries, pneumoperitoneum (distension of the abdominal wall) can be avoided and thus the need for anesthesia and paralysis would be unnecessary; and in plastic/reconstructive surgery, subcutaneous tissue and fascial planes can be elevated without the need to make large incisions, leading to the possibility of incision-less and thus scar-free cosmetic surgery.

New cellular and molecular disease mechanisms provide the basis for improved therapies. A novel gene termed ""B-aggressive lymphoma"" (BAL) was found to be significantly more abundant in tumors from patients with fatal (versus curable) cases of DLB-CL. Researchers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute have identified a novel BAL-associated protein, ""B-lymphoma and BAL-associated protein,"" or BBAP. In addition to binding BAL, BBAP undergoes self-ubiquitination; ubiquitination affects the function of proteins involved in cellular regulation.

"491","Licensable Technology","BCL-X Gamma: A Novel bcl-x Isoform","Cantor, H","Members of the family of BCL-2-related proteins serve as regulators of apoptosis.  The bcl-x gene product, closely related to BCL-2-related protein family, also protects cells from apoptosis.  Researchers at the Dana-Farber have identified novel molecules referred to as BCL-x gamma nucleic acid and protein molecules.  These molecules are useful as modulating agents in regulating a variety of cellular processes.  Analysis of the BCL-x gamma protein indicates that it contains a BH1 and a BH2 domain that are found in other BCL-x family members.  However, the BCL-x gamma protein also contains a novel gamma domain that includes an ankyrin domain.  The gamma domain of the deduced BCL-x gamma protein lacks homology with the C-termini of previously described murine BCL-x gamma isoforms, including BCL-xL, BCL-x beta or BCL-x deltaTM.  Since BCL-x gamma does not contain an apparent hydrophobic domain flanked by charged residues it is unlikely to be membrane-bound.

Applications/Advantages: The BCL-x gamma isoform has been detected selectively in thymus, lymph nodes, lung, and eye, but not in heart, intestine, kidney, liver or brain. BCL-x gamma has been found to be expressed only in T-lymphocytes since its message is detected in lymph nodes from BALB/c control but no from BALB/c nu/nu mice or from Rag-2 deficient mice. The fact that BCL-x gamma has been detected in double positive thymocytes indicates that it plays a role in thymic selection not played by other BCL molecules. Thus, unlike other forms of BCL-x molecules, BCL-x gamma proteins are specifically connected to TCR ligation and are essential for resistance to TCR-dependent apoptosis."," Drug Discovery Tools","http://www.dfci.harvard.edu/res/technology/available.asp?case_number=491&keywords=&category_id=4&category_name=Targets+and+Screens","Ojas Mehta, Phone (617) 632-5807, Fax (617) 632-4012, Email Ojas_Mehta@dfci.harvard.edu","Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"

However, the factors that stimulate the growth of beta-cells are not yet well understood. The basis for this invention is the finding that beta-cell replication occurs even in the postdevelopmental state of beta-cell growth. It appears that a coordinated and regulated process of beta-cell replication that is analogous to an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition plays a role in maintenance of beta-cell mass.

It is vital to develop new devices and materials to overcome these fundamental limits.  Increasingly, “off-roadmap” technologies will become the answer to the questions of tomorrow’s microelectronics industry.  With portability becoming a major driver in consumer electronics, there is a strong need for a new class of materials and devices capable of delivering power consumption, speed, and memory capacities that match or exceed the performance of the current state-of-the art.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:VO2 is a material known for having a number of outstanding properties that allow it to meet or exceed those of current silicon-based opto-electronics.  It is capable of ultrafast switching, low leakage, and is scalable to size-scales smaller than that of conventional silicon, allowing for higher densities of logic and memory elements.  Furthermore, as a simple thin-film technology, it is compatible with conventional CMOS processing techniques and can be integrated with existing silicon devices.  However, several challenges have kept VO2 away from practical use.   First, it has been difficult to make “pure” VO2 because oxides of vanadium end up taking numerous forms (VxOy).   Therefore, it has also been difficult to show that the material indeed can be induced via electric fields to exhibit phase transitions (i.e. change in resistance that would enable electronic switches).  Professor Ramanathan has overcome these issues.  He has developed and demonstrated methods to make thin films of VO2 (the dioxide version, which is the desired oxide version) that are uniform and consistent.  Furthermore, Dr. Ramanathan has shown that phase transition (resistance change) can be triggered electrically at room temperature.

"CCMC   1418","Licensable Technology","Bioenhanced Repair of ACL Injuries","Murray, Martha M.","ACL tears account for 550,000 patients each year.  Repairing the ACL with sutures alone has a failure rate of over 90 percent.  Therefore, the current gold standard of treatment is to replace the ACL with a graft of tendon taken from elsewhere in the knee or from a cadaver.  However, recent studies at the Boston Children's Hospital have discovered why the failure rate for repairing the ACL was so high, and have come up with a novel strategy to overcome that problem. ||

In ligaments which heal successfully, such as the MCL, bleeding from the torn ends of the ligament forms a blood clot between the two torn ends.  That clot serves as a scaffold for surrounding cells to invade and remodel, successfully healing the ligament.  The ACL lives in the fluid environment of the knee, and although it bleeds when torn, the blood clot is washed away from the injury site, so there is no connection between the torn ends, and no place for the wound healing process to occur.  ||

The team at Boston Children's Hospital has found a substitute scaffold which can hold the blood clot in place between the two torn ends of the anterior cruciate ligament and provide a protected space for wound healing to occur for the ACL.  The procedure is far less invasive than the current techniques of ACL reconstruction, with no required graft harvest or large tunnels to be drilled in the bones. ||

Surgical Technique: |
• Suture attached to the femur at the ACL attachment site there |
• ECM Scaffold threaded onto suture |
• Suture passed thru tibial tunnel and tied over the tibial cortex |
• Scaffold saturated with biologically active component ||
Using these tools and procedure in preclinical studies, this technology has demonstrated healing ligaments with similar strengths to ligaments replaced with tendon graft, and the knees which had the ACL repaired had less osteoarthritis than those that were reconstructed at one year after surgery.  The scaffold is a unique sponge made of natural proteins that can be combined with the patient's own platelets at the time of surgery. ||

    This invention relates to the field of extracorporeal blood treatment systems, such as bioartifcial liver support devices. 

 BACKGROUND 
    A variety of conditions are characterized by an organism's inability to maintain the hemodynamic stability of its circulatory system. In many conditions, hemodynamic instability is associated with an organism's failure to perform one or more of the following normal functions: detoxify blood, metabolize products in the blood, synthesize products required for the maintenance of hemodynamic stability, and modulate factors from the hormone or immune systems. Prominent examples of conditions that result in hemodynamic instability include loss of organ function and sepsis.

ABSTRACT:
Methods and devices are provided that improve the function of organ support devices, and also provided are improved methods of treating conditions associated with hemodynamic instability.

The platform that was used involved the quantitation of endothelial injury and repair as a biomarker of chronic rejection/CAV. Dr. Bricoe's laboratory has studied how the alloimmune  response targets graft vascular endothelial cells as a characteristic component of the rejection process. In these studies serum collected from cardiac transplant recipients/patients with and without CAV were used as our index. Serum samples were evaluated using a starndard protein profiler platform. The lab identified 10 molecules that were statistically associated with CAV. By ROC, VEGF-A and VEGF-C were significantly associated with disease. They also generated a classification and regression tree approach (CART) to identify that serum levels of VEGF-A, VEGF-C, along with Angiopoietin-1, and Angiostatin can be used to diagnose CAV with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity in the study population.  The other candidate biomarkers identified  include Angiopoietin-2, artemin, urinary plasminogen activator, vasohibin, placenta growth factor, and platelet factor 4.

The biopotential of the organism is then measured with electrodes at the electroporated portion of the organism. The portion of the organism that is electroporated can be, for example, a skin surface of the organism. A resistance-decreasing agent, such as heparin, sodium thiosulfate, thioglycolic acid solution and dithioglycolic acid can be applied to the tissue surface to facilitate reduction in electrical resistance. Another example of a resistance-decreasing agent is a keratin-disrupting agent, such as sulforhodamine. Examples of suitable biopotential measurements include electrocardiographic, electroencephalographic, electromyographic, electrohysterographic and elctrokymographic measurements.

"3845","Licensable Technology","Bisphosphonates as novel adjuvants to enhance the adaptive immune response, validated with common types of vaccine antigens and commercial vaccines","von Andrian, Ulrich H.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Despite decades of adjuvant research, only four adjuvants have been approved in the seven major markets.  Of these, only two (Alum and AS04) are licensed in the US.  The availability of additional adjuvants has been minimized due to increased safety requirements imposed by the regulatory authorities. Although Alum is safe and efficacious in many prophylactic indications (particularly in those vaccines achieving protection through a strong Th2 response), it has proven unsuccessful in many indications.  The development of novel adjuvants is therefore an area of high interest for many companies.Small molecule adjuvants are pharmaceuticals included in vaccine preparations to enhance the immune response and protection generated by vaccination.  The inventors present evidence that two bisphosphonates can stimulate the adaptive immune response against multiple types of antigens.  This suggests that bisphosphonates may be useful as adjuvants in the development of novel vaccine preparations, and particularly beneficial for:•  Use with poorly immunogenic antigens.  Increasingly, new infectious disease vaccines have moved away from whole cell/virus preparations toward individual non-infectious subunits.  These preparations are safer, but less immunogenic.  The inclusion of adjuvants may increase the potency of the immune response generated by vaccines containing these less immunogenic antigens.•  Use in patients with compromised immune systems.  In elderly or other immune-compromised patients, immune responses to traditional vaccines can be muted.  The addition of an adjuvant can increase the potency of immune responses in these patients.•  Use in vaccine preparation when antigen is difficult to produce.  Some adjuvants can decrease the amount of antigen required to develop protection by vaccination.  This may decrease the cost of vaccine production when an antigen is particularly expensive.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Despite decades of adjuvant research, only a handful of adjuvants have been approved in seven major global markets and only two (Alum and GSK’s AS04) are licensed in the US.  The availability of additional adjuvants has been minimized due to stringent requirements imposed by the FDA and EMEA. Several adjuvants like Although Alum is safe and efficacious in many prophylactic indications (particularly in those vaccines achieving protection through a strong Th2 response), it has proven unsuccessful in vaccines for pathogens (e.g. TB, HSV, HIV and malaria) that require a more complex immune response for vaccine effect like a CMI/ Th-1 type response. Unmet needs in the vaccine adjuvants include the following:1.     Safety and non-toxicity with minimal systemic and local side effects 2.     Broad immunogenicity across all branches of the human immune response pathway, especially cell-mediated immunity (Th1)3.     Ability to be used with mucosally-delivered vaccines, DNA vaccines, cancer and autoimmunity vaccines, live and inactive viruses, proteins, haptensTherefore, the development of novel adjuvants is an area of high interest for many companies.Novel adjuvantBisphosphonates are clinically approved and used extensively for the treatment of bone resorption diseases, such as osteoporosis.  The von Andrian laboratory discovered a novel function for bisphosphonates by showing that they also enhance the adaptive immune response to a wide variety of antigens.  Furthermore, bisphosphonates engage molecular pathways that are distinct from Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, such as AS04.  Bisphosphonates may therefore be effective as novel adjuvants in vaccination, and have a straightforward path to the clinic.Novel mechanism of immune enhancement:  To determine the mechanism of action of bisphosphonates on immune enhancement, the von Andrian laboratory investigated the effects of four specific bisphosphonates on immune cells. Their findings, summarized below, distinguish bisphosphonate adjuvant activity from that of other marketed and known adjuvants:•     Bisphosphonates at clinically relevant doses when injected subcutaneously increase antibody responses to live and inactive viruses, proteins, haptens and existing commercial vaccine formulations (e.g., Hepatitits B vaccine Egenerix). This effect was observed following administration of bisphosphonates prior (up to 60 days), concomitantly, or after (up to 4 days)•     Bisphosphonates increase the migration of dendritic cells from the site of injection to the local lymph nodes, increasing antigen presentation to B- and T- cells. Theytarget directly B cells and enhance B cell expansion and antibody production upon antigen encounter. These data establish bisphosphonates as a novel class of adjuvants that boost humoral immune responses.•     Bisphosphonates exert their adjuvant-like activity in the absence of CD4+ and gd T cells, neutrophils or dendritic cells and their effect does not require local macrophage depletion nor does it depend upon Toll-like receptor signaling or the inflammasome."," Therapeutics - Drugs","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3845","Michal Preminger, (617) 432-0920","Harvard University"

In the inventors' previous research, the regulation of 13,000 genes in brain tissue from patients with bipolar disorder was examined, and numerous changes in expression levels of genes were found in the brains of subjects suffering from bipolar disorder compared to control subjects (McLean invention reference MCL 2256.0). The greatest differences were seen in genes whose expression products involve mitochondrial function or energy utilization. In more recent research, the inventors found that differential expression of certain of these genes can also be seen in lymphocytes of bipolar subjects compared to controls, when the lymphocytes are treated ex vivo in a certain manner. Specifically, lymphocytes of normal controls responded to glucose deprivation with an up-regulation of nuclear transcripts for proteins of the electron transfer chain, whereas subjects with bipolar disorder had a tendency to down-regulate these transcripts (McLean invention reference MCL 3104.0).

     Potential Commercial Uses: By enabling circulating cells to be used in this assay, the new research enables a simple, rapid blood test that can be used to diagnose bipolar disorder. The invention features a diagnostic method for detecting the presence of, or propensity for, bipoloar disorder in a patient by detecting specific patterns of gene expression in lymphocytes subjected to a specific ex vivo treatment.  The test is simple and easy to carry out, in that it can be conducted using easily-obtainable blood samples from patients, using standard methods of measuring gene expression. The test provides a quick diagnosis of whether the patient has a genotype which puts him or her at risk of developing psychotic disorders such as bipolar disorder.

"UMD 07-11","Licensable Technology","Blue-Light Cured Adhesives for Joining Fabric","Paul Calvert","This invention provides a novel method for joining two or more pieces of cloth together without creating a stitched seam. Using thread for stitching is the principal method used by apparel makers to join pieces of cloth, but seams can be bulky and/or obtrusive, so in many cases it is desirable to eliminate or minimize seams for aesthetic or practical reasons. For example, for active wear such as workout clothes or bras, or elbow and knee braces, seams can irritate through recurring friction on the skin caused by exercise movement.

The invention makes use of monomers which can be polymerized by application of blue light in the presence of a suitable catalyst, in order to join fabric pieces. Ultraviolet cured acrylic adhesives have been used in various applications including the joining of transparent materials and coatings, but blue light (with a wavelength of approximately 400-475 nm) may be used instead, particularly in applications where ultraviolet light might damage tissues or materials. The invention comprises a method in which small dots of mixtures of specified monomers and catalysts are deposited between the layers of materials desired to be joined, using a syringe or other method of injection, followed by application of blue light to cause polymerization of the monomers to form the desired adhesive. Light emitting diodes provide convenient, small, and intense light sources and are increasingly available with wavelengths in the blue range. A preferred monomer for the method is pentaerythritrol propoxylate triacrylate, and a preferred catalyst is camphorquinone (which has an absorption peak of 468 nm). The method is preferably carried out using a device or system resembling a sewing-machine or an assembly line, in which the monomer/catalyst mixture is applied to the fabric in a series of small dots, each of which is then sequentially moved below the light source for immediate light application and curing.

"03718","Licensable Technology","BMP Inhibitors in Ossification, Anemia and Inflammation","Yu, Paul B.; Cuny, Gregory D.; Bloch, Kenneth D.; Peterson, Randall T.; Hong, Charles C","Technology:
Investigators in the Cardiology division of MGH and BWH have developed small molecule inhibitors of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway. These compounds preferentially inhibit the kinase activity of BMP type I receptors, versus TGF-beta receptors. Derivatives of these compounds that have improved potency, half life and selectivity, and are well-tolerated in vivo have also been generated (eg. LDN193189). The BMP inhibitors are effective in the treatment of congenital and acquired diseases. 
In mouse models of anemia, atherosclerosis and ectopic bone formation, these inhibitors achieve significant normalization of the disease phenotype. The NIH Rapid Access to Interventional Development (RAID) Program is supporting IND-enabling studies of the inhibitors, while NIH- Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND) is funding the development of compounds optimized for the treatment of FOP. 

Applications:
- In a mouse model of the orphan disease Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), excessive bone formation or heterotopic ossification (HO) was inhibited (Yu et al 2008). Similar effects on bone, in addition to reduction of inflammation and pain, are expected in ankylosing spondilitis (AS).
- In erythropoietin (EPO)-refractory anemia of inflammation (AOI), BMP inhibition increased serum iron availability and corrected the defect (Steinbicker 2011, Theurl 2011). This may enable the use of lower doses of EPO, in turn reducing potential side-effects. 
- Additional indications would include anemia of chronic disease (ACD) such as those associated with cancer, autoimmune disease and IBD (Wang et al., 2011).
- In LDLR-knockout mice, lipid/cholesterol levels were lowered and the development of vascular calcification, atheroma and atherosclerotic disease was significantly retarded (Derwall etal 2011). 
- In ApoE- knockout mice (Saeed et al 2012) and in MGP-knockout mice, vascular calcification and atherosclerosis were retarded 
- In a model of inflammatory colitis, macrophage-mediated inflammation in response to S. typhi was attenuated (Wang et al., 2009).

Advantages:
- The only known small molecule inhibitors which inhibit BMP signaling, in vitro and in vivo. 
- Provide effective therapies for hitherto untreatable diseases like FOP, HO and ACD. 
- The compounds are safe and non-toxic at effective doses and generated via a reliable synthetic pathway.
- Provide an orally available therapeutic strategy, with ease of dosing and lack of immunogenicity.

Scientists have tried a number of approaches, from simple histological stains (developed generations ago) that allow them to distinguish small subsets of neurons to sophisticated array tomography (Micheva and Smith 2007). Still, so far it has been difficult to develop a comprehensive, precise view of the brain's wiring diagram.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:This invention is a set of fluorescent protein transgenic mice whose neurons have the potential to display every color of the rainbow. In these mice, various neuronal cell types possess multiple fluorescent protein sequences uniquely flanked with pairs of incompatible Lox sites alternated to create mutually exclusive recombination events. Each neuron may express one of a wide variety of possible fluorescent protein combinations, and therefore emit a distinctive hue. Depending on the type of analysis used, over 89-166 colors may be distinguished. This, in turn, allows the unambiguous identification and tracing of multiple cells within a neuron ensemble, a critical step toward mapping the ''connectome''. Such wiring diagrams should lead to better understanding of diseases such as autism and schizophrenia, as well as new insight into learning and other cognitive functions."," Drug Discovery Tools  |   Therapeutics - Methods  |   Research Reagents  |   Therapeutics - Methods  |   Research Reagents","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=2611","Mick Sawka, (617) 496-3830","Harvard University"
"704","Licensable Technology","Breast Cancer Susceptibility Test","D'Andrea, A","This invention is based on recent discoveries in the regulation of the FA/BRCA pathway. Dr. Alan D'Andrea of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute has discovered that Fanconi anemia proteins are linked to BRCA1 in a common pathway. One protein in this pathway, FANCD2-L, plays a critical role in this pathway and the DNA-damage response. If this protein is defective (i.e., exists as FANCD2-S instead of FANCD2-L), then the individual has an increased risk of developing breast cancer. This molecular test is an important tool in the early detection of breast cancer since the patient can be screened for the presence or absence of FANCD2-S at the very outset of cancer development. Dana-Farber has monoclonal antibodies that are useful for FANCD2-S detection.

In addition to the protein/antibody based test that can distinguish between FANCD2-S and FANCD2-L, the Dana-Farber has also developed a nucleic acid based test to distinguish between the normal and defective coding sequences for FANCD2. FANCD2-L (normal) is targeted to subnuclear foci, where it co-localizes with BRCA-1 and RAD51 to participate in the DNA-damage repair response. FANCD2-S (defective) does not co-localize with BRCA-1 or RAD51.

Applications/Advantages: Current genetic breast cancer diagnostics screen for mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 as a way of determining breast cancer susceptibility. One limitation of this method is that BRCA1 mutations account for only a small fraction of breast cancers (approximately 5%). The pathway described by Dr. Alan D'Andrea - specifically the FANCD2-S protein - can be screened to determine breast cancer susceptibility and offers broader screening possibilities than currently available diagnostics (i.e., identifying breast cancer susceptibility even where there is no BRCA1 mutation).

A FANCD2 based breast cancer test also holds advantages over non-genetic tests.  Mammograms and self-tests can detect cancer when the tumor has already developed, but these tests cannot detect the underlying genetic changes that lay the groundwork for tumor growth.  Due to this inherent shortcoming, mammograms and self-tests cannot serve as early detection systems."," Diagnostics/Biomarkers","http://www.dfci.harvard.edu/res/technology/available.asp?case_number=921&keywords=&category_id=5&category_name=Diagnostics","Elena Moir, Phone (617) 632-4018, Fax (617) 632-4012, Email elena_moir@dfci.harvard.edu","Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"

They have been proposed as the basis of new sensors, nanoscale electrical circuits, molecular delivery systems, photonic sources, thermal conductors, mechanical fibers, chemical catalysts, and as critical components for a wide variety of other applications. Central to many proposed electronic device-based applications of nanowires and carbon nanotubes is the development of methods that enable organization over large areas with controlled orientation and density. While progress has been made in studies of individual or small numbers of nanowire and nanotube devices prepared by directed assembly and centimetre scale assembly of nanowire field effect transistor arrays by the Langmuir-Blodgett technique, it is unclear if these can be scaled to large wafers and non-rigid substrates needed for many applications and/or efficient processing. It is still imperative to promote the large scale assembly of well-ordered nanostructures with controlled orientation and density into hierarchical functional systems.This general and scalable, low temperature method involving bubble expansion of homogeneous epoxy suspensions of nanowires and carbon nanotubes can produce large area films.Applications include:•     Manufacturing different types of nanosystems •     Nanowire field-effect transistor devices and multifunctional coatings •     Continuous films productionINNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:The invention describes a general and scalable, low temperature method involving bubble expansion of homogeneous epoxy suspensions of nanowires and carbon nanotubes to produce large area films. The nanowires and carbon nanotubes are well aligned in the films, and the density can be readily controlled by starting suspension concentrations. Moreover, the average nanowire separation can be systematically controlled by adjusting the loading percentage of nanowires in the bubble solution.   The nanomaterial-embedded bubble films can be conformally transferred to a variety of substrates such as single crystal wafers, large flexible plastic sheets, highly-curved surfaces and also suspended across open frames. The bubble process produces very uniform film thickness of each bubble. The simplicity, generality, and potential to extend to much larger area films offers substantial promise for applications of one-dimensional nanowires and carbon nanotubes.  This technique could offer substantial savings over traditional high-vacuum approaches to deposition.The generality of this approach has been further shown with carbon nanotubes. The resulting single-walled nanotubes and multiple-walled nanotube films are distinct from previously reported filtration films, buckypapers, or yarned sheets. Filtration usually produces multiple layers overlapped nanotubes, while the single-walled nanotube films obtained through the bubble expansion method consist of a single-layer of ordered nanotubes. For making device arrays, individual nanotubes with controlled separation and alignment are more desired. The substitution of different nanowires or nanotubes enabled by this approach can be very attractive for creating different functional nanosystems with functionalities such as light-emitting diode arrays and logic/memory arrays.This approach can be applicable to other types of nanostructures (e.g. nanoparticles) to produce very large scale thin film embedded with well-ordered nanomaterials.This approach is general to other polymer/solvent systems, not limiting to current Epoxy/THF. For example, it is possible to prepare BBFs by using water/ethanol polymers (such as polyethylene oxide (PEO), polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) and etc.), or photolithography-compatible polymers (e.g. SU-8 series photopolymer), which could be important to develop nanodevices for biological research, life sciences, etc."," Microelectronics/MEMS  |   Microelectronics/MEMS  |   Nanotechnology/NEMS","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=2784","Mick Sawka, (617) 496-3830","Harvard University"

"4188","Licensable Technology","Cancer Metabolism: SIRT4 as a Key Regulator of Glutamine Metabolism","Haigis, Marcia C.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Cancer therapy:   Activators of SIRT4 may be a novel, promising approach for modulating cancer metabolism, since many tumors require glutamine for an energy source and for survival.  Tumors, with their increased energy demand and dysregulated metabolism, may be especially susceptible to inhibition of glutamine metabolism, leading to tumor death with minimal effects on nearby normal tissues.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Background - Cancer Metabolism:  In many cancer cells, glutamine is the primary mitochondrial substrate and is required for maintenance of mitochondrial function and integrity.  Glutamine is an essential metabolite for proliferating cells.  Cancer cells show high levels of glutamine metabolism and glutamine is required for oncogenic activation. Some tumor cells, such as those with enhanced expression of the c-Myc oncogene, can not survive in the absence of glutamine.  Methods for modulating the level of glutamine metabolism in a cell therefore offer great promise for the prevention and/or treatment of cancer.Background - SIRT4:  SIRT4 is a mitochondrial-localized member of the sirtuin family of NAD-dependent deacetylases. SIRT4 represses glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) through ADP-ribosylation and deacetylation. GDH is an enzyme which converts glutamate to alpha-ketoglutarate, which then enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) to produce energy.SIRT4 is a Key Regulator of Glutamine Metabolism: Dr. Haigis’ laboratory has shown that SIRT4 represses, and is a key regulator of, glutamine metabolism. Cells treated with DNA damaging agents (DNA synthesis inhibitors; UV light) have significantly reduced glutamine consumption and NH4+ production, as well as significantly increased expression of SIRT4 and SIRT4 protein (and not SIRT1, SIRT3 or SIRT5).  Using SIRT4 knock out cells, and cells that overexpress SIRT4, the lab further showed that SIRT4 is required for the repression of glutamine metabolism in response this genotoxic stress.SIRT4 inhibits tumorigenesis:  In vitro data demonstrate that SIRT4 knockout cells, but not SIRT4 wild-type cells, acquire a tumorigenic phenotype.  They further show that glutamine metabolism is essential for the transformative properties of these cells.  In vivo studies demonstrate that SIRT4 knockout mice have substantially increased tumor incidence, and in particular lung tumors.  Ongoing studies in the lab are focused on the role of SIRT4 in tumorigenesis, and identifying the targets of SIRT4 implicated in glutamine metabolism and DNA damage."," Therapeutics - Drugs","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=4188","Michal Preminger, (617) 432-0920","Harvard University"
"1996-1201","Licensable Technology","Cancer treatment by targeted depletion of vitamin B1","Fulton, Chandler; Lai, Elaine Y.","• The Situation: Current cancer therapies are not only toxic to patients, but also inefficient in killing quiescent cells residing in solid tumors that frequently cause relapses. Aberrant expressions of oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes in cancer cells also contribute to the high failing rate in cancer treatment.

• Our Solution: Thiamin, also know as Vitamin B1, is a coenzyme essential for cellular energy metabolism. We have developed a novel method, localized apoptosis induced by depletion of thiamin (LAIDT), which promises to overcome present difficulties in cancer therapy. 

Background:
Each year in United States, 300,000 men are affected by prostate cancer, 200,000 women are affected by breast cancer, and 100,000 individuals are affected by colon cancer. Over $15 billion is spent every year to treat these cancers alone. However, existing cancer therapies, which target rapidly proliferating cells, are toxic to patients. Also, standard chemo- and radiation therapy cannot eliminate quiescent cells in solid tumors, resulting in frequent relapses. Furthermore, drug-resistance mutations, over-expression of the bcl-2 gene (an anti-apoptotic oncogene), and loss of the p53 gene (a tumor suppressor gene) are causing some cancers to be strongly resistant to treatments. 

Applications:
Cancer therapy; elimination of other unwanted cells.

Advantages:
• This invention utilizes a novel paradigm for cancer therapy: induces apoptosis of targeted cells by creating a local deficiency of an essential nutrient.
• Efficiently eliminates hard-to-kill quiescent, bcl-2 over-expressing, or p53-deficient tumor cells. 
• No intrinsic toxicity.
• Antidote available (vitamin B1).

Technology:
The present invention is based on the discovery that apoptotic cell death can be induced by creating a local deficiency in the natural vitamin, thiamin. This technology is applicable to cancer treatment and to eliminate other unwanted cells. For therapeutic use, localized depletion of thiamin will be achieved in vivo by targeted application of thiaminase (an enzyme which cleaves thiamin) to tumors, localized expression of the thiaminase gene, or use of targeted small-molecule thiaminase analogues. Furthermore, the method allows rapid reversal of the effects of the deficiency at any time such reversal is desired, simply by the administration of replacement thiamin. Our investigators have shown that a recombinant thiaminase, originated from the amoeba Naegleria gruberi, is remarkably stable and kills p53-null cancer cell lines in vitro. The many promising attributes of this new technology warrant its development into a major cancer therapeutic method of the future.

Doxorubicin and it's liposomal formulation Doxil are highly potent chemotherapy drugs. However, therapy with these drugs comes at the expense of cardiotoxicity in a significant number of patients. The inventors have identified certain compounds that maintain the efficacy of doxorubicin against tumor cells, while ameliorating it's cardiotoxic effects. 
These compounds can be used at various stages of doxorubicin therapy. The compounds have been tested for their cardioprotective effects in both zebrafish and mouse models of doxorubicin-induced cardiac side effects.

"CCMC   1964","Licensable Technology","CD154 as a target for the treatment of thrombotic and inflammatory diseases","Wagner, Denisa D.","CD154 (also known as CD40L and gp39) is a transmembrane protein in the TNF family, originally identified in CD4+ T lymphocytes and implicated in various immunological functions. Proteolytic cleavage of the CD40L receptor produces the soluble form, sCD40L, which is known to be actively released following platelet stimulation and during acute coronary thrombosis. Building upon work demonstrating CD40L expression in many cells within the vasculature, researchers in Dr. Denisa Wagner’s lab at Boston Children’s Hospital have discovered an expanded role for CD40L in platelets. ||

In addition to being found on immune cells, CD40L is known to be expressed on activated platelets. Upon interaction with the CD40 receptor, CD40L expressed on platelets is hydrolytically cleaved into its soluble form, which causes it to lose endothelial activating potential. Through binding experiments with recombinant sCD40L, work in the Wagner lab demonstrated that sCD40L binds directly to the aIIbB3 platelet integrin through a KGD motif and that ligand binding induces platelet stimulation and is necessary for the stability of arterial thrombi. Based on this research, compounds that modulate the mobilization of CD40L from platelets, including CD40L antagonists, agents that inhibit hydrolysis or metalloproteinase inhibitors, may provide novel treatments for disorders characterized by inflammation or thrombosis."," Therapeutics - Drugs  |   Drug Discovery Tools","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=1964","Dietz, Ryan, ryan.dietz@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"
"CCMC   2956","Licensable Technology","CD45 Phosphatase Inhibition as a Treatment for Heart Disease and Fibrosis","Bischoff, Joyce","Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) is a developmental and repair process where endothelial cells lose adhesion with their neighbors, increase their migration and become precursor cells. While CD45 has been implicated in loss of adhesion in hematopoietic cells, it has never been observed on non-embryonic endothelium. A common side-effect of EndMT is fibrosis, which can have serious pathological consequences such as thickened mitral valve leaflets, causing mitral regurgitation, and can result in tissue ossification in patients with cerebral cavernous malformations, intimal thickening at sites of atherosclerosis, arterial calcification, and fibroplasia ossificans progressiva.||

Work from Dr. Joyce Bischoff’s lab suggests that pathological EndMT after ischemic injury can be prevented by inhibiting CD45. Using an ovine model of ischemic injury, Bischoff found that CD45 was expressed in endothelial cells after ischemic injury, but not in normal endothelial cells. This result was confirmed in vitro by showing endothelial cells induced to undergo EndMT by TGFß  expressed CD45.  Finally, the investigators found that TGFß-induced EndMT can be blocked by inhibiting CD45 phosphatase activity, as indicated by a decrease of cellular migration and by a loss of other EndMT hallmarks. Drugs based on this discovery have the potential to reduce EndMT-mediated fibrosis  after ischemic injury, aid in the prevention of mitral valve  disease, and provide a treatment for fibroplasia ossifcans progressiva"," Therapeutics - Drugs","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=2956","Dietz, Ryan, ryan.dietz@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"

"MCL 3661.0","Licensable Technology","Cell Sorting Codes for Purification of Neural Stem Cells and Stem Cell-Derived Neurons","Ole Isacson, M.D. Ph.D., et al.","Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive motor system disorder affecting as many as one million Americans, and is one of several neurodegenerative diseases characterized by neuronal cell loss. Because the regenerative capacity of the adult brain is very limited, cell transplantation therapies have been used to treat neurodegenerative disease, with moderate success. However, widespread application of cell-based therapies will depend upon the availability of large amounts of neuronal precursor cells having consistent characteristics. Preferably, the precursor cell populations would be highly enriched for the therapeutic cell type, and cells that might cause deleterious effects such as neural tumors should be reduced or eliminated. Neural cells differentiated in vitro from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) exhibit broad cellular heterogeneity which limits their usefulness. The invention is based on the discovery, isolation, and characterization of specific neural stem cells that are derived in vitro from hESCs, and also features a powerful methodology for sorting and purifying specific cell populations.
     Potential Commercial Uses: The invention overcomes many of the hurdles seen to date in proposed cell therapy approaches, by providing homogeneous and well characterized cell populations, enriched in the cell types most likely to have therapeutic effects. Analysis of cell surface markers shows that these subpopulations contain a significant fraction of neurons or neuronal precursors, confirming their potential usefulness in cell therapy applications. The invention therefore enables preparation of homogeneous populations of neuronal precursor cells that can be used in cell therapy approaches for treatment or prevention of PD. Such methods can make use of autologous transplants using populations purified from a patient's own cells, or eventually a standardized product for heterologous transplants. The invention also features methods for identifying and sorting neuronal cell populations that are expected to have significant value in research and clinical applications.

Lithium exhibits numerous physiological effects in animals. For example, lithium mimics insulin action by stimulating glycogen synthesis and is remarkably effective for the treatment of mania in many human patients.  Research over the years has demonstrated that lithium administers these effects, in part, through the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3b), an enzyme involved in the regulation of glycogen synthesis and cell fate determination in diverse organisms such as humans, Dictyostelium, Drosophila melanogaster, and Xenopus laevis.  But lithium treatment in humans is also accompanied by several serious side effects, such as tremors, renal dysfunction, thyroid abnormalities, and birth defects. Additionally, lithium is not administered to patients having significant renal or cardiovascular disease, severe debilitation or dehydration, and sodium depletion due to a risk of disease exasperations.  Given these problems, it is imperative to discover other drugs that can inhibit GSK3 in the same manner as lithium but without the toxic side effects.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:This cell-based assay is applicable to diverse biological systems for discovery of glycogen synthase kinase inhibitors.  The inhibition of GSK-3b has dramatic morphogenic effects during the early development of numerous organisms, including humans, Dictyostelium, sea urchins, zebrafish, and Xenopus.  In each case, components of the assay mixture (described below) are provided exogenously to a cell by microinjection and scored for their respective phenotypes.The invention is a simple and efficient cell-based assay that allows for quick and easy determination of novel GSK-3b inhibitors.  In brief, a mixture comprising GSK-3, a source of phosphate, GSK-3 substrate, and assay buffer in the presence or absence of the test compound is measured for the level of phosphorylation of a known GSK-3 substrate.  A lower level of phosphorylation of the GSK-3 substrate in the presence of the test compound compared with the level of phosphorylation of the GSK-3 substrate in the absence of the test compound indicates that the test compound is a GSK-3 inhibitor.The system utilizes diverse biological readouts in order to monitor a test compounds activity against GSK-3b. Those compounds exhibiting the expected phenotype are then tested in an in vitro assay for their ability to inhibit GSK-3b phosphorylation on a known substrate.  The cell lysates from these assays are readily tested and quantified using any GSK-3b immunoassay kits."," Research Tools  |   Drug Discovery Tools  |   Drug Discovery Tools","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=1391","Vivian Berlin, (617) 496-0474","Harvard University"

"CCMC   2343","Licensable Technology","Chelation of zinc promotes nerve regeneration within the central nervous system","Benowitz, Larry","Following traumatic nerve injury, ischemic damage, or degenerative diseases such as glaucoma, projection neurons of the eye--the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs)--cannot regrow their axons and soon begin to die, leaving patients with lifelong visual losses.  Past research has discovered ways to activate RGCs’ intrinsic growth capacity and counteract extracellular signals that normally inhibit axon growth in animal models.  However, these methods do not fully arrest the slow loss of RGCs that persists after axonal injury, and even the cells that partially regenerate their axons are likely to be in a compromised state. The present invention concerns novel ways to both suppress cell death and strongly enhance the regeneration of injured axons. ||

Dr. Benowitz’s lab is working to identify cellular and molecular mechanisms that cause RGCs to die after axotomy, and establish ways to counteract these mechanisms, when combined with methods to promote axon regeneration, to restore meaningful levels of neuron regeneration and lost function. ||

Dr. Rosenberg's lab has elucidated zinc-dependent mechanisms of cell death in neurons and in oligodendrocytes, and the signaling pathways that are activated by elevation of intracellular free zinc and by oxidative stress.  His lab continues to focus on basic mechanisms of cell death that are important in neurodegeneration and in white matter injury. ||

The two labs discovered that there is a rapid elevation of free zinc in the retina after the optic nerve has been injured, and that this zinc strongly inhibits neuronal survival and the regrowth of axons in an optic nerve injury model. Mitigation of this elevation in free zinc promotes regeneration of injured axons. These findings can be applied therapeutically, alone and in combination with other approaches, to disorders and diseases of the CNS caused by axonal injury such as spinal cord trauma, optic nerve injury, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, stroke and CNS trauma.  ||

The inventors envision an implantable device, or other means of delivering the therapeutic formulation, such as nanoparticles, for promoting regeneration in a lesioned nerve or tract within the central nervous system."," Therapeutics - Drugs","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=2343","Caron, Connie, connie.caron@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"

The researchers' strategy is to insert a third element between the two ligands that can be cleaved by light to split the two ligand groups apart. The researchers developed a photo-cleavable chemical inducer of dimerization that consists of two different protein-binding ligands connected by a linker that can be broken by exposure to 405nm light. This compound allows the researcher to gain control of engineered proteins within cells by adding the compound and subsequently inactivating it at will with light. This allows the experimenter to control precisely when and where in the cell the link is broken."," Research Tools  |   Medical Imaging","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=2583","Caron, Connie, connie.caron@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"

"0375","Licensable Technology","Chemical synthesis analysis program","Corey, Elias J.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:When planning a laboratory synthesis, the expert organic chemist does not simply apply every reaction that might be used to make the target structure and all intermediate structures.  Rather, s/he identifies one or more strategies and tactics to guide the analysis in the direction of maximal retrosynthetic simplification of the target.  In a similar fashion, LHASA (an acronym for Logic and Heuristics Applied to Synthetic Analysis) uses strategies and tactics to emulate the chemists' reasoning and limit the scope of the search for transforms.  There are five major strategies in LHASA: functional-group and pattern-based, topological or ""strategic bond"", key-transform, stereochemical, and starting-material-oriented.  To assist the chemist in selecting strategies, a ""LHASA Suggestions"" mode has recently been implemented in which the program suggests tactics based on its perception of synthetically-significant structural features.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:The computer program LHASA, which has been under continuous development at Harvard and various collaborating universities for more than 25 years, is intended to assist organic chemists in designing multistep routes to complex molecules.  The program accepts as input a target molecule drawn in the language of structural formulae that is common to all organic chemists.  A perception of the target is conducted to identify molecular features that influence the development of retrosynthetic routes (e.g. functional groups, stereocenters, rings, etc.) The user is then prompted to specify a strategy and substrategy, or tactic, to guide the retrosynthetic analysis.  Finally, the program selects retroreactions (""transforms"") from its chemical knowledge base in accordance with the processing tactic and applies these transforms to generate retrosynthetic precursors which are structurally simpler than the target.  The user selects one of the precursors for further processing, and the analysis proceeds in an interactive fashion until readily available hypothetical starting materials are obtained.Interaction with the program is entirely graphical, allowing chemists with little or no computer experience to use the program effectively. Considerable effort has been expended to enhance the user-friendliness of the program.  New features include on-line setup menus for modifying run-time parameters, graphical display of perception information, algorithms for automated selection of strategies and tactics, and on-line explanations of button functions."," ","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=0375","Gwen Miner, (617) 495-3067","Harvard University"

Researchers at Brigham and Womens Hospital have developed a novel galectin-1 human immunoglobulin chimeric fusion protein, Gal-1-hFc, to overcome the stability issues encountered with native and recombinant gal-1 preparations. Currently, reducing agents such as DTT and 2-ME are routinely used to prevent oxidative inactivation of Gal-1. Our novel Gal-1hFc mimics the native structure Gal-1, while maintaining functionality, without requiring reducing agents.

Applications:	

The fusion protein can be used for assaying Gal-1, Gal-1 ligand mediated activities in a number of laboratory methods. The fusion protein should also be evaluated as a therapeutic for treating autoimmune disorders. 


Advantages:	

-Mimics the native structure Gal-1, while maintaining functionality (e.g., binds canonical ligands           without chemical stabilizers), unlike other Gal-1 formulations.
-Will avert non-specific Fc-mediated cytoxicity responses, allowing for more accurate interpretation of Gal-1 function in autoimmune/inflammation responses in vivo.
-Contains an IgG Fc domain for detection in various laboratory assays.
-Does not need reducing agents (e.g., DTT) for structural and functional stabilization, eliminating ancillary effects of these agents such as induction of unnatural protein folding or T cell apoptosis independent of Gal-1 function.

"20405","Licensable Technology","Cholesterol Metabolism-Related Molecular Diagnostic for Myocardial Infarction Risk","Musunuru, Kiran ; Kathiresan, Sekar","The Technology:

Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is a causal risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI). The 9p21 SNP and KIF6 markers currently used in diagnosis mainly predict risk in European populations, but not in African American populations. Recently a lack of association of the KIF6 marker with disease, or with statin outcomes was shown (Hopewell JC, et al., 2011; and Ridker PM, et al., 2011.) 
Inventors in the cardiology division at MGH have identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in chromosome 1p13, rs12740374, as being responsible for a strong association with LDL cholesterol levels and risk for MI. The major allele at this locus is associated with up to 40% increased MI risk in European populations; whereas the minor allele is associated with decreased secretion of VLDL particles, lower blood LDL cholesterol levels and lower MI risk. moreover, these lipid-assocaited loci are relevant in East and South Asians.

Applications:
-	A molecular diagnostic or pharmacogenetic test is envisioned for the detection of risk of myocardial infarction across all ethnic groups, including in African Americans. 
-	Patients with the high-risk genotype, particular young people at higher risk of MI may therefore warrant more aggressive, earlier therapy.
-	This SNP is entirely independent of the 9p21 SNP and KIF6 marker currently used and would be additive in risk prediction to these markers in European populations; and as a stand-alone marker in African American populations.

Advantages:
-	A rare pharmacogenetic test in the cardiovascular space.
-	Applicable across all ethnic groups 
-	Individuals at a higher risk for CVD and MI can be identified earlier, and preventive measures or lifestyle changes can be implemented.
-	Test may be offered via CLIA labs to clinicians 
-	High-throughput format.

Stage of Development:  Human data obtained, PCR-based test available.

The present invention is based on the discovery of two novel broadly immunogenic tumor antigens, chronic myelocytic leukemia-like (CML) proteins CML28 and CML66.  The CML28 antigen is immunogenic in patients with different solid tumors as well as in patients with leukemia; antibodies specific for CML28 were found in patients with melanoma and prostate cancer.  In contrast, high-level expression in normal tissues was highly restricted.  Since CML28 is preferentially expressed in tumor tissue, this antigen is a promising immunotherapy target.  Like CML28, CML66 is expressed in leukemias and solid tumors, and CML66 was detected in sera from patients with lung cancer, melanoma, and prostate cancer.  As with CML28, expression of CML66 in normal tissues was highly restricted.

Applications/Advantages: Both CML28 and CML66 hold promise as targets for antigen-specific immunotherapy in different solid tumors as well as leukemias.  Comparing with other cancer-testis (CT) antigens, CML28 has wider expression pattern in a variety of tumors.  This invention provides both CML protein and gene, and methods for CML expression, detection and modulation.  For example, antibodies specific to CML proteins are provided which are useful for the detection, prevention and treatment of cancers.  Similarly, this invention provides nucleic acids as hybridization probes to determine the presence of CML-encoding genes.  These detection schemes are useful for both diagnostic and prognostic assays, guiding the clinician in both therapeutic and prophylactic approaches, respectively."," Therapeutics - Methods","http://www.dfci.harvard.edu/res/technology/available.asp?case_number=722&keywords=722&category_id=&category_name=Search+Results","Elena Moir, Phone (617) 632-4018, Fax (617) 632-4012, Email elena_moir@dfci.harvard.edu","Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"

"2004-0202","Licensable Technology","Clonable gold label for electron microscopy","Mercogliano, Chris; DeRosier, David","• The Situation: Current methods for labeling proteins for electron microscopy use gold clusters attached to specific tags on proteins. The fraction of tags labeled with a gold cluster is small, and cell membranes must be removed so that gold clusters can enter cells.  Non-specific attachment of gold clusters can cause misinterpretation of images.

• Our Solution: We developed a novel clonable protein tag that allows gold atoms to form a cluster directly onto the protein tag, thereby circumventing problems associated with introducing preformed-gold clusters into cells and with non-specific labeling. This clonable label also provides a way to purify protein by affinity columns.

Background:
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which can resolve cellular structures down to Angstrom levels, has been a great source of information for a wide range of biological studies. Clonable labeling tags for light microscopy, such as green fluorescent protein, have revolutionized biology, but few such agents have been developed for TEM. Gold nanoclusters are traditionally used to label biological structures for electron microscopy studies; however, introducing preformed heavy metal clusters into cells is an inefficient labeling process, and detergent treatment of tissue samples necessary for metal cluster penetration can cause damage to samples, resulting in experimental artifacts. We have developed a clonable labeling method for TEM in which a small metal-binding protein, metallothionein (MT), is used as a fusion tag for labeling proteins. By incubating cells in a solution with gold-containing compounds, gold atoms can diffuse across cell membranes and assemble directly onto the MT-tag of targeted protein. This may circumvent the problems associated with introducing preformed gold clusters into cells.

Applications:
1. For electron microscopy studies, MT-tag allows efficient labeling of intracellular molecules with gold without compromising the samples with detergent treatment.
2. Metallothionein also binds other heavy metal atoms such as mercury and silver. MT-tagging technology can be used as an affinity-purification means in conjunction with an immobilized affinity column charged with metal ions such as cadmium.

Advantages:
• Provides a method for labeling and purification of proteins. This technology can be easily incorporated into cloning kits and protein purification kits.
• Electron-dense gold clusters form directly onto the MT-tags of targeted proteins. Therefore, this labeling method does not require demembranating samples and provides more accurate and complete protein localization than is possible with gold-nanocluster-conjugated secondary antibodies.
•  MT-tag is one-forth the size of GFP, hence posing fewer risks for steric hindrance and folding problems to targeted proteins.
• Metallothionein is present in many organisms. Species-specific MT-expression vectors can be tailored-made for different biological systems, thereby optimizing protein expression and avoiding codon-usage problems caused by a “generic” tag.
• Since MT-tag can be used for affinity purification, this invention provides a means to isolate the very same protein, for further analyses. It may even allow co-purification of specific organelle markers, which can then be used to verify the intracellular location of the targeted proteins.

Technology:
This invention provides compositions and methods for heavy atom labeling of target proteins using a clonable metallothionein (MT) tag. Metallothioneins constitute a super family of low molecular weight, cysteine-rich proteins that bind to various metal ions to protect cells from heavy metal toxicity. This invention applies the metal-binding characteristic of metallothionein for the development of a novel protein labeling method for electron microscopy. The MT-tag, like green fluorescent protein, can be cloned onto a protein of interest. The gold label permits visualization of target protein by electron microscopy, but unlike traditional gold labeling methods, electron-dense gold clusters assemble directly onto the MT-tag from monomeric gold and does not require forceful introduction of preformed gold clusters into cells. In addition to gold, MT-tag permits protein labeling by other heavy metals, such as silver and mercury. Furthermore, MT-tag provides means for affinity purification of protein. The inventors have successfully demonstrated that proteins labeled with MT can be efficiently purified on immobilized metal affinity chromatography columns charged with cadmium ions.

They have been proposed as the basis of new sensors, nanoscale electrical circuits, molecular delivery systems, photonic sources, thermal conductors, mechanical fibers, chemical catalysts, and as critical components for a wide variety of other applications. Micro- and nano-electronics based on semiconductor carbon nanotubes (CNTs) require methods of controlling their properties and of preserving those properties once gained.  The inventors have shown for the first time that both p-type and n-type CNTs (semiconducting) can be predictably and repeatebly produced and preserved by coating CNTs with selected materials.  It has been further demonstrated that efficient and reliable dielectric coating of CNTs can be performed by vapor deposition techniques.Applications include micro- and nano-electronics.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:FETs were made by combining the techniques of Harvard Case 2093 to produce CNTs extending over a trench between two electrodes with the coating techniques of the present invention and conventional photolithographic techniques.The invention is a method for the coating of suspended nanotubes with silicon nitride (Si3N4) using low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (CVD).  This issued patent includes the fundamental design of suspended carbon nanotube transistors.

A three-terminal field-effect transistor has been produced by coaxially coating the nanotube with a nitride and a metal layer, allowing nanotubes to be used as both active and passive sensor elements."," Nanotechnology  |   Physics  |   Nanotechnology","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=2281","Alan Gordon, (617) 384-5000","Harvard University"

According to one aspect, the present invention is directed to reducing and/or eliminating the artifacts that are inherent in previous near field coded aperture imaging systems such that the improved sensitivity and resolution of these systems can be practically utilized. A system and method of the present invention utilizes two projections of radiation from an object, the first through a first coded aperture mask pattern, and the second through a second coded aperture mask pattern, where a decoding array associated with the second mask pattern is the negative of a decoding array associated with the first mask pattern. Data from both projections is combined to produce a reconstructed object image that is substantially free of near-field artifacts. The present invention additionally relates to further improvements in the sensitivity and spatial resolution of coded aperture imaging applications. More particularly, the present invention relates to improvements in the design and fabrication of coded aperture masks for use in coded aperture imaging devices. Improvements can be made to the resolution, for instance, by selecting smaller pixel sizes for the opaque and transparent elements of the coded aperture mask. Also, it is possible to improve the signal-to-noise ratio for near-field applications by selecting an appropriate thickness for the mask. The signal-to-noise ratio may be further improved by selecting the appropriate mask pattern based on the particular characteristics of the near-field imaging problem at hand."," ","http://www.ipvisioninc.com/findurl.php?uid=mitDossier:8979","Ben Palleiko","Massachusetts Institute of Technology"

In 2007, Dr. Zetter's studies detected Collagen XXIII protein at very low levels in benign prostate tissue, whereas a significant increase in Collagen XIII in was seen in prostate cancer. Distant metastases exhibited significantly higher collagen XXIII levels compared with either localized prostate cancer or regional (lymph node) metastases. Patients with high collagen XXIII levels had a 2.8-fold higher risk of Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) failure with median time to failure of 8.1 months, compared with low collagen XXIII patients with a median time to failure of 5 years. The presence of collagen XXIII was significantly associated with time to PSA recurrence, independent of other clinical variables. Collagen XXIII was also detected in prostate cancer patient urine, with reduced levels after prostatectomy, indicating potential as a noninvasive fluid biomarker.||

In additional studies published in 2010, Dr. Zetter's lab found that collagen XXIII could be used as a tissue and urinary biomarker for NSCLC, in which positivity in tissue or urine significantly correlates with the presence of NSCLC and high staining intensity is a significant recurrence predictor. Dr. Zetter's studies found that Collagen XXIII was present in tissue samples from a variety of cancers. Within lung cancer tissues, collagen XXIII staining was enriched in NSCLC subtypes. Collagen XXIII was present in 294 of 333 (88%) lung adenocarcinomas and 97 of 133 (73%) squamous cell carcinomas. ||

"20442","Licensable Technology","Colorimetric Analyte Sensor","Medarova, Zdravka ; Ghosh, Subrata Kumar; Moore, Anna V","The Technology:
Inventors at MGH have developed a colorimetric sensor which undergoes a color change upon interaction of the sensor with a defined concentration of analyte. For example, in the absence of the analyte, the sensor is red. Upon addition of the analyte in concentrations less than or greater than the target concentration, the sensor remains red. Upon addition of the analyte at or close to the target concentration, the sensor turns green. This sensor permits accurate quantitation of analyte concentration with the naked eye, without the use of calibration curves or specialized equipment.

Application:
The sensor can be used in settings where specialized equipment is not available, such as in home-testing settings or in low-tech clinical settings. One specific application of the technology is a kit for testing mobile zinc in seminal fluid to diagnose prostate cancer. This kit could be in the form of a multi-well plate with wells containing different concentrations of the sensor, in which one well turns green upon interaction with the analyte, indicating the concentration of the analyte. The kit could also be in the form of a test strip with multiple reaction sites, where dipping the test strip in a solution of the analyte indicates the concentration of the analyte and/or the risk associated with the analyte concentration.
 
Advantages:
- Convenient: Permits fast, accurate determination of analyte concentration with the naked eye, without the use of calibration curves or specialized equipment.
- Inexpensive: Requires only sensor solution and kit, does not require expensive equipment such as fluorimeter.

Dr. Leonard Zon has discovered methods for treatment of melanoma using an inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) and a combination therapy that involves an inhibitor of oncogenic BRAF combined with an inhibitor of DHODH. Dr. Zon's lab has also developed assays for identifying compounds useful for the treatment of melanoma. The methods comprise screening for compounds or agents that inhibit neural crest progenitor formation in a zebra fish model of melanoma.||

Dr. Zon's lab determined by gene expression analysis that melanoma cells adopt a fate similar to multipotent neural crest progenitors. In studies, they used zebrafish embryos to identify the initiating transcriptional events that occur upon activation of oncogenic BRAF(V600E) in the neural crest lineage. Zebrafish embryos that are transgenic for mitfa:BRAF(V660E) and which lack p53 have been found to have a gene signature that is enriched for markers of multipotent neural crest cells, and neural crest progenitors from these embryos fail to terminally differentiate.||

In particular, they discovered that BRAF(V600E):p53-/- embryos exhibit an abnormal expansion in the number of crestin+ progenitors. Furthermore, in the adult, BRAF(V600E):p53-/- virtually all tumor cells, but no normal cells, are positive for crestin. Thus, they concluded that suppressors of neural crest progenitors may have utility in the treatment of melanoma. ||

They then developed a screen to identify inhibitors of the crestin+ lineage during development, allowing for identification of compounds or agents useful for melanoma treatment. Dr. Zon's lab screened a library of 2,000 chemicals for suppressors of neural crest development in BRAF(V600E):p53-/- zebrafish and successfully identified compounds useful in the treatment of melanoma."," Therapeutics - Drugs  |   Sensing/Imaging  |   Therapeutics - Drugs","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=1610","Meyer, Abbie, abbie.meyer@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"

The invention is a chemical process for converting inactive Vitamin E oxidation products, a-tocopherolquinine, back to their active form, a-tocopherol. This novel process converts the oxidized material back to the active a-tocopherol at a yield above 85% thereby increasing the amount of a-tocopherol that can be recovered and decreasing the amount of waste products produced during processing. This can potentially double the activity of a-tocopherolquinine in vegetable oils and can result in greater quantities of active Vitamin E isolated in the processing operation."," Process development  |   Vegetable oils  |   Vitamin-E","http://uml.flintbox.com/public/project/5528/","Rajnish Kaushik, Ph.D., Assistant Director, OTC, Umass Lowell, Ph:978-934-4708/978-935-6592, Email: Rajnish_Kaushik@uml.edu","University of Massachusetts Lowell"

"160","Licensable Technology","Complex of Dideoxynucleoside and Phosphonoformic Acid","Rosowsky, A","Among the more effective drugs available against HIV are those directed against reverse transcriptase, particularly the 2?,3?-dideoxynucleotides such as 3?-azidothymidine (AZT).  Other agents effective at relatively high concentrations against HIV are salts of phosphonoformic acid (PFA) such as the sodium salt.  It has been proposed to employ mixtures of AZT with a very large molar excess of PFA to inhibit replication of HIV or of cytomegalovirus.  Prodrugs of PFA linked to the 5?-hydroxyl of various deoxynucleosides have also been proposed.  However, there has been no indication that these prodrugs might have therapeutic activity in cells infected with retroviruses.

Researchers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute have synthesized a compound having a structure consisting of a phosphonoformic acid partial ester covalently bonded to a 2?,3?-dideoxynucleoside in equimolar proportions.

Applications/Advantages: This new compound is more effective than either component alone as an inhibitor of replication of retroviruses, while at the same time exhibiting low toxicity to the host cells."," Drug Discovery Tools","http://www.dfci.harvard.edu/res/technology/available.asp?case_number=160&keywords=&category_id=1&category_name=Therapeutics","Ojas Mehta, Phone (617) 632-5807, Fax (617) 632-4012, Email Ojas_Mehta@dfci.harvard.edu","Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"

Invention:  This invention provides for a system for the aqueous spinning of silk fibroin to create tubes for a variety of tissue engineering applications. This method of winding an aqueous silk solution around a reciprocating rotating mandrel offers substantial improvement in the control of the silk polymer and resultant tube properties, specifically in regards to winding pattern, tube porosity, and composite tubes.  Silk tube properties are further controlled via different processing mechanisms such as methanol-treatment, air-drying, and lyophilization.

"T001161","Licensable Technology","Composite Coatings by Welding of Layered Precursors","Charalabos Doumanidis","Tufts University Categories:engineering:aerospaceengineering:engineinstrumentationmaterials:compositesAdditional Keywords:(none specified)Invention SummarySummaryResearchers at Tufts University and Northeastern University have invented a precursor-based method to create metal-matrix composite (MMC) coatings.  Wire and surface precursors are deposited on a substrate by controlled thermal processing using plasma-arc, laser and high-density infrared radiation.  The types of materials that can be used as a coating are broad.  The substrates to be coated may be metallic, ceramic or composite.BackgroundMMCs are now used in many areas of manufacturing where combining different properties into one material is critically required.  Most current structural applications in the aerospace, automotive and consumer goods industries use MMCs in bulk form.  The use of full-volume MMCs, however, is not always an optimal choice, particularly in applications where surface properties are of primary importance.There are several existing techniques currently in use for the production of MMC coatings, each with their limitations.  Cladding by rolling, extrusion, drawing and explosive techniques, as well as electroplating methods, provide non-fused, structurally discontinuous bonding of the coating to the base metal with relatively low strength.  Combustion or plasma spray coating techniques can be plagued by porosity due to air or oxide entrapment, as well as adhesion problems due to melting and mixing with the base metal.  AdvantagesThe MMC coatings made possible by this invention represent a significant improvement over existing techniques.  Because the method comprises melting the surface portion of the substrate along with the MMC and allowing the two to mix and react, the resulting coating is fused to the substrate.  The fused MMC coating offers greatly improved strength over non-fused MMC coatings made by the existing techniques.  On metal substrates, the coating imparts superior mechanical properties in fatigue and hardness, resistance to abrasion, wear, oxidation, corrosion and high temperatures to the coated part.  The substrate in turn achieves greater strength, stiffness and toughness with respect to the metal matrix.  Finally, this method makes it possible to apply a more practical and economical MMC coating on a part, rather than having to rely on solid MMC parts.  ApplicationsThe MMC coatings covered by this invention may be used to coat a wide range of products in demanding environments.  They include:  combustion engine cylinder and piston liners, valves and seats, jet engine components, electrical contacts, bearing rolls, cams, gears, cutting tool and machine tool surfaces, tank pipes, nozzles, etc."," Mechanical Engineering  |   Materials  |   Mechanical Engineering","http://www.tufts.biz/cgi-bin/tech_search.cgi?r=1&case=T001161","Martin Son617-636-3605martin.son@tufts.edu","Tufts University"

"JDP-118","Licensable Technology","Compositions and Methods for Treating Diabetic Eye Disease","Lloyd Paul Aiello, M.D., Ph.D. and Edward Feener, Ph.D.","Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of vision loss in working adults. Nearly all patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and over 60% of those with type 2 diabetes eventually develop retinal microvascular abnormalities, and 20% to 30% of these patients advance to active proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and/or diabetic macular edema. Increased retinal vascular permeability (RVP) is a primary cause of diabetic macular edema and a characteristic finding in PDR. The onset of PDR and diabetic macular edema is thought to result from a change in the balance between pro-angiogenic/permeability factors and anti-angiogenic/permeability factors. Functional proteomics was used to identify novel factor(s) that contribute to the changes observed in the eye associated with diabetes. Such changes include excessive vascular permeability or vascularisation of the eye, e.g., associated with diabetic retinopathy, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, or diabetic macular edema. These studies revealed a number of proteins whose expression levels are altered in PDR and/or macular edema. Among these is one specific protein, a member of a well-studied signaling pathway, the concentrations of which are reduced with diabetes. The lowered levels of this protein appear to reduce inhibition of angiogenesis and permeability and thus allow complications to arise. It is therefore believed that this protein plays a regulatory role in mediating retinal complications of diabetes. The invention features methods of treating retinal vascularisation or vascular permeability in the eye, by administering this protein or peptide fragments thereof, or by administering agents that increase the concentrations of this protein in the eye. This protein has never before been identified as being involved in diabetes or its complications, and therefore represents a new therapeutic target."," Therapeutics - Methods","http://www.joslinresearch.org/inventions","David J.

Researchers estimate that over 90% of the 500,000 cases of cervical cancer that arise worldwide each year may be linked to HPV. In addition to cervical cancer, papillomaviruses commonly induce benign, dysplastic and malignant hyperproliferations of skin and mucosal epithelium, causing warts, plantar warts, venereal warts and others. These skin growths are unsightly, irritating and potentially carcinogenic, and frequently removed. Applications of this technology include:-Treatment for cervical carcinoma-Treatment for warts and other papillomavirus infectionsINNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Dr. Peter Howley's laboratory at Harvard Medical School has developed inhibitors of viral replication. Essentially, they found that a specific, highly conserved peptide sequence essential for replication. Mutations in this sequence blocked replication. More importantly, Dr. Howley's group showed that small peptide fragments inhibit both critical replication functions and viral replication in vitro. His group believes inhibitory peptidomimetics could readily be synthesized using this information.Advantages of the technology include:-Novel approach to inhibitors-Potential for highly specific therapy"," ","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=1486","Michal Preminger, (617) 432-0920","Harvard University"

"2006-0303","Licensable Technology","Compounds and methods for treating mammalian gastrointestinal parasitic infections","Hedstrom, Lizbeth; Striepen, Boris","• The Situation: Cryptosporidium parvum is a waterborne protozoan which infects the intestinal tracts of human, causing persistent diarrhea and enteritis. Chronic Cryptosporidium infection results in a severe and life-threatening condition in patients with AIDS.

• Our Solution: We have identified 10 potent and highly selective small-molecule inhibitors of Cryptosporidium parvum that effectively slow or block the proliferation of this parasite in human and mammals.

Background:
The protozoa Cryptosporidium parvum is an important human pathogen causing severe gastrointestinal disease. Small children, pregnant women, the elderly, and immuno-compromised AIDS patients are at risk of chronic and often fatal infection. C. parvum produces oocysts that are highly resistant to water chlorination. People ingest these oocysts, which then “hatch” in their bodies. Several large outbreaks in the U.S. have been linked to drinking and recreational water. Infection rates are extremely high, with disease manifest in 30% of exposed individuals and a 50-70% mortality rate among immuno-compromised individuals. Effective drugs are urgently needed for treating C. parvum infections in AIDS patients and for managing epidemic outbreaks.

Application:
Treatment for parasitic protozoan infection in AIDS patients.

Advantages:
• 10 potent inosine-5’-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitors have been identified to inhibit C. parvum IMPDH.
• These compounds selectively inhibit parasite IMPDH over human IMPDH, providing effective and safe treatment for patients.

Technology:
The invention provides pharmaceutical compositions and methods that slow or block protozoan parasite proliferation in human and mammals by selectively inhibiting protozoan inosine-5’-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH). All parasitic protozoa lack purine biosynthetic enzymes and must salvage purine from their host, making this pathway an extremely attractive target for developing anti-protozoal drugs. IMPDH is a key enzyme in the purine salvage pathway. The investigators have shown that: (1) IMPDH inhibitors block parasitic proliferation in vivo; and (2) the protozoa C. parvum IMPDH has very different properties than that of the human enzyme, allowing the screening for inhibitors specifically against protozoan IMPDH. A commercial library containing 44,000 compounds were screened at the National Screening Laboratory for the Regional Centers of Excellence in Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Disease (NSRB), and 10 compounds were identified to be potent specific inhibitors of C. parvum IMPDH. The invention provides possible novel and effective treatments for the many devastating diseases caused by protozoan infections.

"20927","Licensable Technology","Compounds for reducing Intra-cellular Lipid Storage in Rare Disease and iPS Cell Model","Wu, Sean M.","Technology:
Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital have identified compounds to treat neutral lipid storage disease, myopathy subtype (NLSD-M). This disease causes elevated triglyceride storage in blood granulocytes, and is characterized by cardiac and skeletal myopathy. They achieved this by developing an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) based screen that recapitulates the disease in a mouse model. The importance of this invention is two-fold. First, by doing so they have shown proof of concept that iPSCs can be used to model rare diseases and screen for compounds in vitro. Secondly, they have identified several FDA- approved compounds that were able to normalize the intracellular lipid levels in differentiated iPSCs from mice, as well as humans with the disease; and show improvement in lipid level and cardiac function in vivo in mice.  


Applications:
This proof of concept to use iPSCs to recapitulate human disease offers the hope of a novel screen to test other compounds in such a screen in other human diseases. NLSD-M is a rare disease with no available treatment. Further development of these compounds could lead to a treatment where there is an unmet need.

Advantages:

-Identification of genes involved in the disease pathway could lead to better treatments.
- Allows for small molecule screening and potential hits and proof of concept in disease modulation. 
- May be applicable to other metabolic disease affecting cellular energetic metabolism such as diabetes, obesity, ischemic heart disease, and heart failure.   
- Recapitulation of human disease in an iPSC model allows for compounds to be screened in a more human-like disease model.

Current therapy for this disease, which relies primarily on replacing brain dopamine using oral doses of the dopamine precursor L-DOPA, has had only limited effectiveness.  This invention features the use of a family of chemical compounds to treat PD, and arises from the identification of a new molecular target for this disease.  There have been observations that expression of the transcription factor Nurr1 is down-regulated in midbrain dopamine neurons with increasing age, and so activation of this factor may facilitate the survival of dopamine neurons and increase the production of dopamine by increasing the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase, the enzyme catalyzing the rate-limiting step for dopamine biosynthesis.   Using a Nurr1-based screening assay, the inventors have identified as drug candidates for Parkinson's Disease a family of compounds that includes known chemical entities with a history of safe use in humans.

Long QT syndrome (LQTS), a disorder of prolonged cardiac repolarization, carries an increased risk of sudden death. The affected patient population includes children, teenagers and young adults. Currently, there are no approved or effective therapies for the treatment of long QT syndrome that address the fundamental problem of prolonged myocardial repolarization time. 

The technology is a new use of existing compounds and their derivatives rescue long QT syndrome in patients by shortening cardiac repolarization time. These two compounds, 2-MMB and Flurandreolide, resulted in significant shortening of the ventricular action potential durations (from 482 +/- 83 msec to 338 +/- 44 msec for 50 uM flurandrenolide and from 570 +/- 23 msec to 376 +/- 66 msec for 50 uM for 2-MMB) in a dose-dependent manner, without directly inhibiting channel function.

Applications:
1.	Meets the clinically unmet need by Treatment of:
        a) Patients with LQTS-type 2
        b) Drug-induced LQTS, (as the Vast majority of drugs associated with acquired QT prolongation are known to interact with the hERG potassium channel)

"733","Licensable Technology","Computational Method to Identify Human Infectious Disease Agents","Meyerson, M","This invention, from recent work conducted in the laboratory of Matthew Meyerson, M.D., PhD. of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, relates to a novel method for detecting microbes harbored by a host organism. Identification pathogens is a particularly useful application of this method. Pathogens are suspected to be linked to diseases in which the origin is unknown, including several cancers, autoimmune disorders and inflammatory diseases. This invention relies on the fact that a diseased individual will contain not only host genomic DNA and messenger RNA, but also the genetic information of the pathogen. Via the Computational Subtraction Method, sequences derived from the diseased individual are filtered against a genomic database of host sequences (such as the human genome) using computer algorithms. Significantly similar sequences are eliminated, leaving pathogen-enriched sequences to guide identification of the infectious agent.

Applications/Advantages: Traditionally, microbiologists have attempted to identify pathogens by culturing specimens obtained from infected tissue. Some pathogens may not be readily cultured; therefore the sources of the corresponding diseases are unclear. More modern molecular techniques likewise suffer limitations. In contrast, the Computational Subtraction Method may be used to identify foreign microbes in a comprehensive and unbiased manner, regardless of the ability to culture the infective agent. This invention holds both diagnostic and therapeutic utility. For example, sequence information may be used to produce antigenic peptides, which in turn may be used for the production of diagnostic antibodies. Likewise, these peptides can be administered to individuals to elicit a protective immune response."," Diagnostics/Biomarkers","http://www.dfci.harvard.edu/res/technology/available.asp?case_number=733&keywords=733&category_id=&category_name=Search+Results","Elena Moir, Phone (617) 632-4018, Fax (617) 632-4012, Email elena_moir@dfci.harvard.edu","Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"

Siekmeier, M.D., et al.","The invention provides a valuable adjunct to high-throughput screening (HTS) and other tools of modern drug discovery for neuropsychiatric disorders. Specifically, it comprises a method for computer modeling in a computational network constructed from simulations of  biologically realistic neurons. These simulated neurons are assembled into a neural network that will react analogously to, and mimic, human systems.  The system models disease-afflicted neural tissue and its reaction to pharmacological interventions at targets such as cell surface ion channels.

The methodology defines the electrostatic complement for a given target site and geometry. The electrostatic complement may be used with steric complement for the target site to discover ligands through explicit construction and through the design or bias of combinatorial libraries. The definition of an electrostatic complement, i.e., the optimal tradeoff between unfavorable desolvation energy and favorable interactions in the complex, has been discovered to be useful in ligand design. This methodology essentially inverts the design problem by defining the properties of the optimal ligand based on physical principles. These properties provide a clear and precise standard to which trial ligands may be compared and can be used as a template in the modification of existing ligands and the de novo construction of new ligands. The electrostatic complement for a given target site is defined by a charge distribution which minimizes the electrostatic contribution to binding at the binding sites on the molecule in a given solvent. One way to represent the charge distribution in a computer system is as a set of multipoles. By identifying molecules having point charges that match this optimum charge distribution, the determined charge distribution may be used to identify ligands, to design drugs, and to design combinatorial libraries."," ","http://www.ipvisioninc.com/findurl.php?uid=mitDossier:7591","Jim Freedman","Massachusetts Institute of Technology"

Researchers at Boston Children’s Hospital have characterized the structure of one the most important targets of pre-erythrocytic vaccines, Thrombospondin Repeat Anonymous Protein (TRAP), which is known to mediate sporozoite gliding motility and cell invasion in both hosts and carriers. Using x-ray crystallography, Tim Springer and colleagues identified both open and closed conformations of TRAP. This led to the development of a method for producing and optimizing antigens that allow for the generation of antibodies to either conformation. Immunization with their modified TRAP proteins demonstrated the production of high-titer antibodies in mice and rabbit models."," Research Tools  |   Research Tools","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=2370","Dietz, Ryan, ryan.dietz@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"

The CLDDD delivers a medication to the eye at a constant rate and in a unidirectional manner over a period of weeks to months. ||

Many eye conditions and ocular diseases such as glaucoma receive first line treatment with medications applied topically directly to the eye surface. It is estimated that of the medications delivered to the eye in the form of an eye drop, only 1-7% is absorbed by the cornea. Furthermore, 80% of an eye drop is lost after one blink. Most of the remaining eye drop is drained through the tear duct and nasal-lacrimal system, which is then absorbed systemically-- the result of which can be low blood pressure, heart failure and shortness of breath. The difficulty for some patients in self-administering eye drops in the home, and issues related to adherence, also leads to serious side effects. ||

Drs. Kohane and Ciolino designed the lens in a way such that the drugs are entrapped in a solid degradable scaffold. The CLDDD consists of a drug-polymer film encapsulated within a contact lens. Both the film construction and the encapsulation method developed with this technology are integral for facilitating the uniform drug release observed. The design also allows for different quantities of drug loadings and drug delivery lifetimes (from one day to as long as a month), pursuant to various existing treatment plans. The CLDDD is therefore designed to deliver medication to a patient in a manner that is both more effective and less cumbersome than existing treatments. Currently, the lens is being developed to deliver latanoprost to treat glaucoma, a leading cause of preventable blindness."," Therapeutics - Methods  |   Medical Devices  |   Therapeutics - Drugs","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=1701","Khunkhun, Rajinder, rajinder.khunkhun@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"

"20979","Licensable Technology","Contrast Agents for Screening for Parkinsons Disease","Bacskai, Brian","Technology:
Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence probes are an exciting and relatively new method for detecting levels of toxic proteins in neurodegenerative disease models. The major impediment to date has been poor signal to noise ratios and slow clearance of unbound dye. Our investigators have identified smart optical probes that emit a characteristic fluorescence signal only when bound to their specific target, opening the door for more rapid screening of compounds in the early stages of drug development and more accessible imaging technology for academic labs. The invention available for licensing consists of a suite of novel NIR fluorescence imaging compounds for use in pre-clinical research.

Applications:
-Tracking levels of proteins implicated in neurodegenerative diseases.
-Dyes can detect levels of both aggregated and soluble beta-amyloid, making them very useful for Alzheimers disease research.
-Some dyes have an affinity for synuclein and Lewy body structures, which could be used for Parkinsons disease research.

Advantages:
-MRI and PET technologies require the use of far more dangerous, costly and less stable radioactive dyes for obtaining data, inhibiting access outside of well-funded laboratories that also have radioactivity permits.
-Current imaging techniques can only detect aggregated beta-amyloid in vivo, limiting the ability to detect all events related to amyloid load. These dyes can give a more detailed idea of what is happening biologically.
-Fluorescence properties of these compounds make them ideal for faster and cheaper screening of drug compounds, allowing investigators to track changes in protein load longitudinally in the same animal. 
-NIR imagers are relatively much cheaper than alternatives (MRI, PET), suggesting greater likelihood for ready adoption by academic laboratories.

The phosphorus vapor is generated by using a source GaP wafer placed at a higher temperature than that of the main process wafer in the mass transport process. When high phosphorous vapor concentration is desired, other solid sources such as InP or red P can be used. To minimize vapor loss to the ambient, both wafers are enclosed in a quartz tube equipped with a quartz plug. However, the source wafer generates not only phosphorus but also gallium vapor. The latter interferes with mass transport and needs to be filtered out. This is conveniently accomplished by employing a larger (longer) process tube and by further placing the source in a smaller inner tube within the main process tube. The source inner tube first directs the vapor to a cooler region, where gallium is selectively condensed out before it reaches the process wafer."," ","http://www.ipvisioninc.com/findurl.php?uid=mitDossier:8720L","Ben Palleiko","Massachusetts Institute of Technology"

The techniques result in vector fields which maximize the generated object's similarity to the target object while minimizing structural changes to the source object. Minimization of structural changes is done by associating directional spring functions with points in the source object and finding a vector which generates an object for which changes in the directional spring functions are minimized. Further included are techniques for reducing the computational cost of finding a correspondence by making a set of pairs of increasingly-simplified representations of the source object and the target object and then finding pair vector fields for the pairs, beginning with the most simplified pair and ending with the original representations of the source object and the target object. The increasingly-simplified representations have the property that they preserve the large-scale structure of the original representations of the source object and the target object. The pair vector field for a given pair is found by extending the pair vector field found for the next simpler pair so that it applies to the pair's source object and then using the extended pair vector field as the initial vector field in finding the pair vector field.

"MCL 1997.0","Licensable Technology","Corticosteroid Conjugates and Uses Thereof","Martin Teicher, M.D., et al.","This invention involves specific chemical modifications to corticosteroids (also known as glucocorticoids), to overcome certain side effects that are common to this category of drug. Glucocorticoids are commonly used for the treatment of a variety of inflammatory or autoimmune diseases. Approximately 10 million new prescriptions for oral glucocorticoids are written each year in the U.S. alone. The frequency of oral glucocorticoids use has been estimated from community survey data to be 0.5% of the general population and 1.75% of women over the age of 55 years.  It has been estimated that 56% - 68% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis receive continuous oral treatment with glucocorticoids.  This is a large and very attractive market in which there are no exclusive name-brand drugs due to generic competition. Glucocorticoids are relatively inexpensive drugs, but it is the sheer volume used that is significant overall; the total market size is believed to be about 10 billion U.S. dollars per year.
Corticosteroids act by binding to receptors which then act to modulate gene transcription in target tissues.  In spite of their efficacy for specific indications, one well-known drawback of the corticosteroids is that they can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, so that such drugs, administered systemically as well as ocularly or topically, can enter the brain, interact with brain tissue, and cause serious adverse effects such as insomnia, depression, severe nausea, headaches and convulsions.  The invention involves specific chemical modifications to corticosteroids, so that the resulting conjugates are peripherally acting steroids with reduced activity in the central nervous system.  The compounds of the invention would be new chemical entities that can be used for the treatment of a variety of disorders including autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) or inflammatory diseases.
     Potential Commercial Uses: The invention provides structurally modified corticosteroids with altered biodistributions. These compounds will have the significant advantage of reducing the occurrence of adverse reactions associated with this class of drug, particularly including CNS-related side effects. No agent has ever been introduced into this class with an improved side effect profile. If these agents succeed only in minimizing adverse neurological and psychiatric side effects they will be widely prescribed, and will be able to command a much higher price than the available generic glucocorticoids. If these agents succeed in preventing secondary adrenal insufficiency they will be so much safer and easier to prescribe that they will send existing glucorticoids into obsolescence.The chemical modification embodied in this invention can be applied to existing drugs, or compounds under investigation, to create new chemical entities which retain the anti-inflammatory activity of the original compound without any CNS side effects. All of the glucocorticoids now on the market have generic formulations, and there are no exclusive proprietary agents in this class. There are presently six prescribed systemic glucocorticoids that can be targeted for formulation into non-blood brain barrier permeable derivatives.

Most of the current noninvasive, continuous blood pressure measurement devices are mechanically intrusive and, therefore, cannot be used for long-term ambulatory monitoring. This new approach requires only simple, noninvasive monitoring devices such as finger photoplethysmographs and an electrical impedance photoplethysmograph (EIP) to monitor the dynamic behavior of the arterial blood flow. In this approach, measured signals from these noninvasive sensors on an arterial segment are integrated to estimate the blood pressure in the segment based on a hemodynamic model. A mathematical model of the arterial blood flow is derived and transformed into a state-space representation. In the modeling, a precise hemodynamic model for the arterial segment on which sensors are located is derived, and combined with relatively simplified models of the upstream and the downstream arterial flows to represent an entire arterial stream. Then, a Kalman filter is designed based on the model and it is shown that the internal variables such as the arterial blood pressure in the arterial segment can be estimated based on the measurements, even though the observability condition of the system may not be met. Simulation results indicate that the approach can generate an accurate estimation of the arterial blood pressure in real-time even from noisy sensor signals."," ","http://www.ipvisioninc.com/findurl.php?uid=mitDossier:8458","Tom Tachovsky","Massachusetts Institute of Technology"

"509","Licensable Technology","Culturing B-Cells for use as Antigen Presenting Cells","Freeman, G","We have developed a novel method of obtaining large quantities of activated B-cells that are excellent antigen presenting cells. Activated B cells can be used to efficiently induce a T cell mediated immune response, thereby modulating an immune response in a multi-administration protocol. The activated B cell serve as APCs expressing all necessary molecules for antigen processing and presentation, are easily accessible, are expandable in vitro, and are able to present efficiently a desired peptide, such as a tumor antigen, to T cells. B cells express MHC class I and II and can therefore be used with a wide range of antigens.

Our method allows normal human B cells to be obtained from peripheral blood, expanded in vitro in presence of immune suppressors to differentially suppress the growth of T cells and activated using CD40 ligand.  The cultures are stable over long periods (at least 6 months) and can be cryopreserved.  These cells are as efficient as dendritic cells for presenting antigen and are fully functional even in the presence of immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-beta.  We additionally have developed a stable CD40L transfectant cell line that cal be used as a source of CD40L for activating the B cells in this protocol.

Applications/Advantages: Antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells are difficult to obtain and culture in large quantities. B cells can serve as APCs, but a method to easily culture them without concomitant growth of T cells is needed. This allows for large-scale culture of APCs (B-cells) that can be readily obtained from a widely available source (peripheral blood)."," Research Tools","http://www.dfci.harvard.edu/res/technology/available.asp?case_number=509&keywords=&category_id=1&category_name=Therapeutics","Ruth Emyanitoff, Phone (617) 632-4010, Fax (617) 632-4012, Email Ruth_Emyanitoff@dfci.harvard.edu","Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"

"CCMC   2585","Licensable Technology","CYP2C8: a target for treating and preventing vascular diseases of the retina","Smith, Lois","Retinal neovascularization, the abnormal formation of excessive blood vessels within the eye, is a chief cause of various vision-impairing diseases including diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). These diseases account for a significant proportion of blindness cases around the world. ||

Previous work in an oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) mouse model demonstrated that neovascularization can be suppressed by a diet rich in Omega-3LCPUFAs (Omega-3-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids) due to the anti-angiogenic metabolites of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase. ||

Interestingly, Dr. Smith and colleagues found that Cytochrome P450 epoxygenases (CYP2C8) can also metabolize Omega-3LCPUFAs, producing various angiogenic epoxides, which are inactivated and converted to transdihydrodiols by the enzyme, soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). In a model of OIR, the researchers observed an upregulation of CYP2C8 and a suppression of sEH, consistent with an increased ratio of retinal epoxide:diol, the byproducts of the reaction pathway. They further explored this association in CYP2C8-overexpressing mice, and in sEH-overexpressing mice subjected to a Omega-3LCPUFA enriched diet. In CYP2C8-overexpressing mice, they found an increase in retinal neovascularization associated with a greater ratio of epoxide:diol and plasma concentration of 19,20-epoxydocosapentaenoic acid. In sEH-overexpressing mice, they observed a decrease in this ratio and concentration. These results strongly suggest that CYP2C8 and sEH are part of a novel lipid metabolic pathway that modulates retinal neovascularization."," Drug Discovery Tools  |   Therapeutics - Drugs","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=2585","Yen, Alan, alan.yen@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"
"641","Licensable Technology","Cytochrome P450 1B1 is a Universal Tumor Antigen Eliciting Cytotoxic T Cell Responses","Nadler, L","Cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) is an extrahepatic, drug-metabolizing enzyme. Recent advances at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute have demonstrated that CYP1B1 is overexpressed in all primary human tumors and minimally expressed in normal critical tissues. This invention provides methods both for immunotherapeutic targeting of CYP1B1-expressing cells and for monitoring the progress of this approach. This technology can be used either as a treatment for pre-existing cancers (including bladder, brain, colon, lung and kidney), or as a prophylactic measure to prevent conditions from arising or recurring in at-risk patients. In either instance, the immunotherapy relies first upon antigen presenting cells that take up and process the CYP1B1 protein or peptide antigen; a series of subsequent events leads to activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which proliferate and kill target cells that express the antigen. The progress of the therapy may be monitored by contrasting CYP1B1-specific CTL levels relative to those obtained from the pre-vaccinated (or pre-stimulated, in the case of ex vivo methodologies) state.

Applications/Advantages: Cancer therapeutics generally do not differentiate between cancer and normal cells, resulting in considerable toxicity. Since CYP1B1 expression is limited in normal tissue, and highly expressed in human cancers, immunotherapy directed against CYP1B1-expressing cells is far more specific. Furthermore, unlike several epitopes in other tumor-associated antigens, CYP1B1 contains epitopes characterized by high binding affinity for the major histocompatibility complex (MHC); MHC binding and MHC-peptide complex stability are important parameters influencing MHC-peptide immunogenicity."," Therapeutics - Methods","http://www.dfci.harvard.edu/res/technology/available.asp?case_number=641&keywords=&category_id=1&category_name=Therapeutics","Ruth Emyanitoff, Phone (617) 632-4010, Fax (617) 632-4012, Email Ruth_Emyanitoff@dfci.harvard.edu","Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"

Syndecan-1 is the major epithelial cell membrane HSPG in mammals. Dr. Pyong Park, PhD, from the Department of Respiratory Diseases, has developed a knock-out mouse by homologous recombination (mutation of exon 1 in a c57BL6 background) to study the physiological functions of syndecan-1 in health and in disease. Despite the variety of functional interactions that have been reported for syndecan-1 in cultured cells, Sdc1–/– mice are ostensibly normal and fertile. Dr. Park has shown that newborn mice deficient in syndecan-1 resist P. aeruginosa lung infection but become susceptible when given purified syndecan-1 ectodomains or heparin, but not when given ectodomain core protein, indicating that the ectodomain's heparan sulphate chains are the effectors. In wild-type newborn mice, inhibition of syndecan-1 shedding or inactivation of the shed ectodomain's heparan sulphate chains prevents lung infection. He also found that a pathogenetic mechanism in which a host response to tissue injury, syndecan-1 shedding, is exploited to enhance microbial virulence apparently by modulating host defenses. Additional work with the syndecan-1 knockout mice in tumorigenesis provided both genetic and biochemical evidence that syndecan-1 can modulate Wnt signalling, and is critical for Wnt-1–induced tumorigenesis of the mouse mammary gland. Further, recent studies indicate that syndecan-1 assures the correct functioning of inflammation by attenuating pro-inflammatory factors and facilitating the resolution of inflammation in a heparan sulfate-dependent manner."," Research Tools  |   Research Reagents","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=1894","Khunkhun, Rajinder, rajinder.khunkhun@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"

John","MARKETS ADDRESSED:This novel technology allows for the efficient delivery of bioactive molecules containing non-natural amino acids, as well as novel chemical entities, into the cytosol of mammalian cells for therapeutic purposes:  •  Delivery of non-natural bioactive molecules:  The delivery of bioactive molecules with non-natural components into the cytosol of cells, includes: peptides and proteins comprising one or more D-amino acids, cyclic peptides and proteins, side-chain modified amino acids, backbone modifications, stapled peptides, and other variants containing a range of non-natural amino acids.  •  Delivery of novel chemical entities: Novel chemical entities can be covalently attached to the toxin using native chemical ligation and/or sortase tagging. Once within the cytosol, molecules can be released from the toxin by proteolytic cleavage. This delivery process is very efficient, using only nanomolar concentrations of reagents.•  Delivery using other AB toxins: In addition to anthrax toxin, this technology may be applied to other AB toxins, since AB toxins all have a similar mechanism of action (e.g. cholera toxin, botulinum neurotoxin, diphtheria toxin, shiga toxin and exotoxin A).•  Cell-type specific targeting:  Specific cell types may be targeted by modifying the receptor binding domain of the respective toxin.•  Stimulation of a protective immune response to antigens containing non-natural amino acids: Chemical entities containing novel biomarkers that contain non-natural amino acids including glycopeptides can be used to stimulate antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells and antigen-specific CD8(+).INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:While there are a number of methods for the delivery of bioactive peptides and proteins into mammalian cells, there is a need for methods to deliver (1) larger molecules that cannot traverse the plasma membrane by a simple diffusive process (e.g. peptides, proteins, small molecules), and (2) agents that are non-naturally occurring (e.g. modified peptides, D-peptides and other organic molecules not normally trafficked into a cell).  In addition, current technologies used to gain therapeutic access to the cytosol are limited in that they require large quantities of sample, have limited selectivity and tend to not escape the endosome.  Many pathogenic bacteria have evolved protein machinery that efficiently delivers enzymes to the cytosol of mammalian cells.  A major class of bacterial toxins, termed AB toxins, uses a transporter protein (B unit) that actively translocates enzymes (A unit) into cells.  Examples of AB toxins include anthrax toxin, botulinum neurotoxin, diphtheria toxin, shiga toxin, exotoxin A and cholera toxin.  In the case of the anthrax lethal toxin, the transporter protein is protective antigen (PA), a receptor-binding/pore-forming moiety, and the enzyme is lethal factor (LF), a zinc protease.  LF binds to PA pores via its N-terminal domain with nanomolar binding affinity, and this domain alone can be used for translocation of compounds.Delivery of non-natural bioactive agents:  Dr. Collier’s laboratory developed a method for the efficient delivery of bioactive peptide and protein molecules containing non-natural amino acids, as well as novel chemical entities, into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells.  Specifically, they discovered that modified versions of bacterial toxins, such as anthrax toxin or other AB toxins, can be used in efficient delivery of these agents.  Their novel results demonstrate that a naturally existing transport system can be used for the delivery of non-naturally occurring proteins and peptides, an unexpected finding since most protein-protein interactions are based on highly stereochemical arrangements.The technology uses the N-terminal domain of LF (LFN) and the transporter protein PA, which when added to cells, form a nanomachine that delivers functional bioactive molecules to the cytosol of a target cell.  In particular, the Collier lab modified LFN by semi-synthesis to probe how structural and electrostatic changes affected protein translocation through PA:•  LFN variant using D amino acids: The LFN domain functioned equally well when the segment was built from D amino acids as from L amino acids, both in its ability to inhibit ion conductance through PA and to be translocated through the pores.  This finding indicates that the LFN does not adopt a conformation that interacts with the pore in a stereospecific manner during protein translocation.•  LFN variant with alternating Lys-Glu sequence: This modified LFN domain demonstrated no significant change versus wild-type LFN in the ability of the protein to block ion conductance or to be translocated.  This finding demonstrates the independence of translocation from strict sequence.•  LFN variants with DTA fusion proteins: For the variants described above, the lab also prepared them with a DTA (diphtheria toxin A chain) fusion protein using chemical ligation or the transpeptidase, sortase A.  These variants behaved essentially identically to those without the fusion protein, indicating that covalent attachment of chemical entities does not affect translocation.  •  LFN variant with cysteic acid: The Collier lab replaced selected acidic residues with cysteic acid, which has a negatively charged side chain, to test whether charge affected translocation. As predicted, this variant strongly inhibited translocation."," Therapeutics - Methods  |   Internet and Communications  |   Therapeutics - Methods","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=4018","Michal Preminger, (617) 432-0920","Harvard University"
"CCMC   2008","Licensable Technology","Delivery of Therapeutic Compounds Across the Blood Brain Barrier","Narasimhaswamy, Manjunath","Delivery of therapeutic compounds to the Central Nervous System (CNS) is complicated by the presence of the blood brain barrier (BBB). Various brain endothelial cells form this highly specialized structure that tightly regulates the transport of molecules from the bloodstream into the brain.||

Traditionally, the only technique available for bypassing this membrane involves disruption of the BBB. However, disruption has proven to be minimally effective and often results in appreciable levels of non-specific entry of neurotoxic molecules. The most common alternative, direct injection, is invasive, high risk, and results in limited dispersal of the therapeutic. To address this problem, Dr. Narasimhaswamy and colleagues have developed a novel delivery method allowing for noninvasive, intravenous, transvascular delivery of therapeutic compounds, including biologics, to the brain. The technology utilizes a peptide isolated from the rabies virus (RVG-9r) which has also been shown to increase the amount and efficacy of compounds already known to cross the BBB. Recent work using this technology has shown suppression of neuroinflammation by targeted delivery of siRNAs to macrophages in the CNS."," Therapeutics - Drugs  |   Drug Delivery","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=2008","Dietz, Ryan, ryan.dietz@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"

The approach is nondestructive, verifiable and comparable.  Results are quantitative and, thus enterable into and searchable against databases. Can be used to quickly and easily determine the density of trace items such as smokeless powders, fibers, rubber/plastic automotive trim fragments, glass fragments, paint chips, glitter, shimmer, bone fragments, ivory, wood fragments, dried tree sap and soil fractions.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Density is a universal property of matter and is one parameter that may be used to characterize a trace object. Although the formula for density (or specific gravity) is simply mass of the object divided by its volume, this is not easily obtained for tiny, irregularly-shaped objects.  This method is based on magnetic levitation (MagLev): objects that are repelled from high magnetic fields (i.e., diamagnetic objects) are placed in a container filled with a solution that is attracted to high magnetic fields (i.e., a paramagnetic solution). When placed between two magnets, the diamagnetic objects are repelled from the magnets and ‘levitate’ within the paramagnetic solution.  The levitation height of a diamagnetic object, within the magnetic field, is directly related to its density.  The vertical position of the diamagnetic sample is independent of mass and/or volume, and thus eliminates the need for standardized sample sizes.Key Advantages:•     Determination of density within minutes, without destroying the sample•     Can distinguish between samples with density differences as small as 0.0002 g/cm3•     Provides values that can be entered into a searchable database•     Does not require expensive instrumentation, a source of electrical power, or a highly-trained operator•     Is readily calibrated with a series of density standards"," Instrumentation  |   Physics","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=4100","Mick Sawka, (617) 496-3830","Harvard University"

Utilizing methylene blue (MB) and eosin dyes that are approved for human use, cells can be stained during surgery and analyzed using fluorescence polarization. The novel fluorescence polarization device uses high resolution and wide-range imaging to scan the stained cells of the tissue with lasers to excite the fluorescence of the dyes. The device then displays color-coded fluorescence and fluorescence polarization images of the tissue region, allowing surgeons to know immediately if they have removed all of the cancerous cells. In addition, researchers have created a quantitative analysis involving an algorithmic ratio to devise a measurable approach to detecting cancer at the single cell level. Using this ratio, it was found that certain cancerous cells exhibit higher fluorescence polarization values when compared with values exhibited by normal cells. This quantitative analysis can be used in a fluorescence polarization device to efficiently detect cancerous cells in vivo.

Epilepsy is characterized by the predisposition to develop spontaneous unprovoked seizures (epileptogenicity). Conventional methods for diagnosing epilepsy involve several clinical visits and workup studies, making it time-consuming and very expensive. More importantly, the diagnosis of several seizures only provides an approximation to the diagnosis of epilepsy.||
Drs. Bosl and Loddenkemper have recognized that electric or electromagnetic signals from patients with a propensity of having seizures may provide reliable biomarkers for diagnosing epilepsy. By matching clinical events that are suggestive of seizures with the concomitant electroencephalogram (EEG) recording, the investigators have identified measurable nonlinear features in the EEG signals that may be used as biomarkers to diagnose epilepsy without the need to identify the occurrence of repeated seizures.||

The method takes advantage of replication machinery of the reovirus, which replicate in distinctive, cytoplasmic inclusion bodies.  Recent evidence from the Nibert laboratory has shown that a single reovirus protein, microNS, is sufficient for forming inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm of transfected cells.  MicroNS is known to associate with and recruit viral proteins to these inclusion bodies.   Colocalization in inclusion bodies is currently being used to identify associations between viral proteins.  In the present invention, the technology platform is extended to detect associations between any two proteins, as well as protein-nucleic acid, protein-membrane and protein-carbohydrate interactions.  Researchers in Dr. Nibert’s laboratory fused a protein of interest as well as green fluorescent protein (GFP; reporter gene) to the µNS protein.

"435","Licensable Technology","Deubiquitinating Enzyme DUB-1","D'Andrea, A","The deUBiquitinating enzymes are a group of ubiquitin-specific thiol proteases; increasing evidence suggests ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis plays an important role in cell growth and cell cycle progression. Recent advances made by Drs. Alan D?Andrea and Yuan Zhu of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute have led to the identification of DeUBiquitinating (DUB) enzymes, a novel sub-family of deubiquitinating enzymes which share similar size and amino acid sequence. The DUB enzymes are of eukaryotic origin, and are accordingly expressed in vertebrates (e.g., mice, humans) and yeast. All DUB enzymes of the present invention are cytokine-inducible, and may be divided into three types. Interleukin-3 (IL-3), interleukin-5 (IL-5) and/or granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) induce the first type, exemplified by DUB-1. The second type, represented by DUB-2, is induced by interlukin-2 (IL-2). Other cytokine-inducible DUB enzymes (e.g., DUB-3, DUB-4, and DUB-5) comprise the third type. Both the first and second DUB types are expressed in hematopoietic cells and DUB-1 has been shown to regulate cell growth.

Applications/Advantages: This technology has therapeutic and diagnostic uses in cancers such as leukemias and lymphomas. Expression of DUB-1 in cells results in arrest of cell growth in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle; methods of the invention may be used to arrest cell proliferation to treat or prevent hematopoietic-based cancers. Accordingly, low levels of DUB-1 in a sample obtained from a patient indicate a likelihood of a hematopoietic-based cancer. In contrast, inhibiting DUB expression promotes cell proliferation. Promoting blood cell proliferation is beneficial for patients requiring blood cell replacement due to disease (e.g., immune suppression resulting from AIDS) or therapy (e.g., chemotherapy, dialysis)."," Drug Discovery Tools","http://www.dfci.harvard.edu/res/technology/available.asp?case_number=435&keywords=&category_id=4&category_name=Targets+and+Screens","Elena Moir, Phone (617) 632-4018, Fax (617) 632-4012, Email elena_moir@dfci.harvard.edu","Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"

Antibodies need to be prepared in cell culture which increases their production cost. Moreover, monoclonal antibody binding to targets is mostly reversible; as a result, very high concentrations of antibodies need to be used in order to reach the required working concentration. In order to constitute effective therapy, often, antibodies need to be developed against more than one target on the pathogen. These facts are compounded by the limited stability of antibody preparations thus making their long term storage difficult. There is a market need to identify innovative methodologies for efficient development of therapeutics.  Technology and Applications: Our researchers have developed a therapeutic system that employs a single effector antibody in combination with two or more molecules directed against different pathogens or different targets on the same pathogen. Epitopes on the pathogen are targeted by corresponding receptor molecules on multiple binding agents, all bearing a common tag. A single anti-tag antibody can then be used for treatment in lieu of multiple antibody preparations. Since the effector antibody is directed against the tag, this system can, in principle, be modified for use against any pathogenic epitope or molecule whose receptor can be coupled to a tag.   Receptor molecules with specificity to pathogen epitopes are linked to a tag to make up a binding agent. The receptors may be polypeptides, synthetic molecules, aptamers, antibody fragments or microproteins. They can specifically bind to any pathogenic molecule; extra or intracellular antigens, released toxins (see figure). The tag comprises an antibody epitope and may be a short polypeptide, sugar or DNA molecule. Since all binding agents bear the same tag, a single anti-tag antibody will suffice as an effector to elicit immune responses.  Advantages:- A single antibody can be used in place of individually targeted antibodies. This obviates the need to expend costly resources for development of targeted antibodies. - The binding agents used here are of differing specificities and replace antibody function by acting as molecular receptors for antigenic epitopes associated with the pathogen. By nature, these are easier to synthesize and amenable to long term storage without associated loss of stability.- This system would facilitate the use of multiple binding agents directed against different targets of the pathogen. Such combination therapy, with two or more binding agents and a single anti-tag antibody is a more effective therapeutic relative to singly targeted antibodies. In instances where a quick identification of the pathogenic molecule involved is not possible; such as determination of toxin serotype in cases of botulism, it is extremely useful to have a single preparation with binding agents targeted to all serotypes rather than use individual antibody preparations.Patent Status: Patent pending"," Diagnostics/Biomarkers  |   Drug Discovery Tools","http://www.tufts.biz/cgi-bin/tech_search.cgi?r=1&case=T001452","Colm Lawler617-636-0338colm.lawler@tufts.edu","Tufts University"

"CCMC   2233","Licensable Technology","Device for endovascular maintenance and repairing the ascending aortic valve","Lock, James","Dr. Lock and Dr. Kozyak have developed devices for endovascular maintenance and repair of the aorta in instances of aortic dilation or aneurysm, as is commonly seen in patients with a variety of congenital heart defects such as bicuspid aortic valve, Marfan Syndrome, and others.  Currently available therapies (endovascular or otherwise) for pathologic dilation of the proximal aorta are extremely invasive and present significant short and long-term risks to the patient. ||

Dr. Lock’s team has developed devices and methods of implantation that endeavor to reduce the invasiveness of therapeutic intervention surgery while reducing the need for multiple procedures and allowing for improved quality of life. The devices are innovative implantable grafts that can be deployed to treat dilated blood vessels, and prevent worsening enlargement.  This is accomplished in several ways.  By allowing a separation of the internal device lumen from the native vessel, the devices are able to modulate the effects of hydrostatic pressure on the vessel wall, limiting one of the primary drivers of progressive dilation. Devices may also comprise strategically oriented fasteners that engage the tissue of the vessel wall, stabilizing the device while mechanically constraining the vessel from further enlargement and enhancing its structural resilience.  ||

While the devices are intended primarily for insertion into the ascending aorta, they can be applied throughout the body in any instance requiring mitigation of vascular dilation, or restriction of flow. Devices may also be fitted with, or coupled to, prosthetic valves, for use in patients with both vessel dilation and valvar dysfunction, as is commonly seen in patients with bicuspid aortic valve or other valve abnormalities."," Therapeutics - Methods  |   Medical Devices","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=2233","Miracco, Amy, amy.rasson@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"

The inventors have demonstrated the presence of circulating autoantibodies to myelin surface proteins (antigens) in patients with ADEM.  In contrast, MOG autoantibodies were identified only in rare cases of MS.  Human serum samples were screened against a panel of candidate autoantigens using protein arrays to identify differential specificity of autoantibodies in serum from ADEM, MS, healthy and encephalitis subjects.   These data  were confirmed using solid and solution phase antibody binding assays.  Serum samples from patients with ADEM revealed robust binding to a wide range of autoantigens, but only a minor subset of samples from MS, encephalitis and normal controls demonstrated binding distinguishable from background.  To confirm these data , two myelin antigens (MBP and MOG) were selected for further evaluation using traditional solid and fluid phase assays. Solid phase binding to these antigens was observed in a minor subset of patients with MS and encephalitis, but solution pahase binding a characteristic of higher affinity antibodies, was absent.  Serum from patients with ADEM contained autoantibodies directed toward MBP and MOG.  In contrast to their counterparts found in MS these autoantibodies demonstrated robust solution phase binding.  These data highlight a fundamental difference in the humoral response of these clinically similar diseases and reflects underlying differences in the pathogenesis of ADEM and MS.
 
The solution phase assay above included the development and use of a novel tetrameric antigen. The inventors developed a novel approach for the detection of autoantibodies, since they can be low affinity and hard to detect in a diagnostic kit:  they have made the antigen multivariant.  Multivariant binding increases the avidity of the antibody/antigen interaction and such stabilized complexes can be more readily detected.  They have generated such multimers by fusing the coding sequence of strptavidin to the N-terminus or C-terminus of the autoantigen (eg MOG myelin loligodendritocyte glycoprotein which has been implicated as a target of autoantibodies in animal models of inflammatory neurological diseases.  This tetramer can be used to examine patients with different inflammatory neurological diseases and identify the subset of patient with ADEM who have high-titer antibodies against MOG.  


Application:
As a diagnostic test to differentiate ADEM from MS which includes a novel detection reagent.  This diagnostic tool has therapeutic implications to guide the care and therapy of patients presenting with CNS lesions.  The discovery could also lead to the development of novel myelin protein-based tolerizing therapies for ADEM. 

Advantages:

"5517","Licensable Technology","Digital advanced television systems","Lim, Jae  S; Monta, Peter","Image quality is improved in high definition television using multi-scale representation of motion compensated residuals. The bandwidths of the subband filters vary with the frequency band and the total number of coefficients in the multi-scale-represented frames is equal to the number of values in the residual. Image initialization in the receivers is achieved using original image leakage, but the leakage factor is varied for different frequency subbands. To free up channel capacity at scene changes, a global (i.e., substantially frame-wide) decision is made as to whether to motion compensate a particular frame. To avoid the unattractive ghost of the previous scene persisting for a short time in a new scene, the motion estimator makes a decision on a block-by-block basis whether to use the original image or the residual. Chrominance resolution is improved by encoding all of the subbands of the chroma residuals, instead of just the low subbands. The chroma residuals are encoded at relatively coarser quantization than the luma residual, but when the energy of the luma residual is low (as, e.g. may occur when there is little motion), chroma quantization is improved, by making an overall (both chroma and luma) reduction in quantization step size. Runlength-amplitude representation and statistical coding are used. Runlength-amplitude representation is applied to entire subbands, and, preferably, different codebooks are used in statistically coding different subbands, to take advantage of the different statistics in the different subbands. The quantization coarseness is adaptively varied based on a computation of the number of bits necessary to statistically code a particular frame, thus guaranteeing for each frame exactly (or approximately, if a small buffer is provided in the decoder) the number of bits available in the channel.","   |   ","http://www.ipvisioninc.com/findurl.php?uid=mitDossier:5517","Jack Turner","Massachusetts Institute of Technology"

While current methods for the directed evolution of enzymes have resulted in some remarkable successes, they generally suffer from limitations in reaction scope. Directed evolution strategies that are general for any bond-forming reaction would complement current methods that rely on screenable reactions or selectable properties of the substrate or product.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Researchers in the laboratory of Professor David Liu have developed a general strategy for the evolution of proteins that catalyze bond-forming (coupling) reactions. The system integrates yeast display, enzyme-mediated bioconjugation, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting to isolate cells expressing proteins that catalyze the coupling of two substrates chosen by the researcher. The system was successfully used to evolve  sortase A for improved catalytic transpeptidation activity. After just eight rounds of screening, the researchers isolated variants of sortase A with up to a 140-fold increase in coupling activity compared with the starting wild-type enzyme. The evolved sortase variants were also shown to enable the much more efficient labeling of LPETG-tagged human CD154 expressed on the surface of HeLa cells compared with wild-type sortase.Because this method does not rely on any particular screenable or selectable property of the substrates or product, it represents a powerful alternative to existing enzyme evolution methods. Beyond improving existing activities of natural proteins for research, industrial, and medicinal use, this enzyme evolution strategy will be valuable in the engineering of artificial proteins with new, tailor-made catalytic activities. A general strategy for the evolution of bond-forming catalysts using yeast display. Yeast cells display the enzyme library extracellularly as a fusion to the Aga2p cell surface mating factor, which is covalently bound to the Aga1p mating factor with a reactive handle (S6 peptide) that enables covalent attachment of substrate A to cells using Sfp phosphopantetheinyl transferase. Substrate B linked to an affinity handle (e.g., biotin, represented by the gray circle) is added to the substrate A–conjugated yeast display enzyme library. Active library members will predominantly catalyze the pseudointramolecular A-B bond formation between affinity handle-linked substrate B and substrate A molecules on their own host cell."," Drug Discovery Tools  |   Research Tools","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=4197","Rene Castro, (617) 495-3663","Harvard University"
"1885","Licensable Technology","Directed evolution of proteins and nucleic acids using nonhomologous random recombination","Liu, David R.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Protein engineering by laboratory directed molecular evolution has proven useful in conferring desired properties upon a wide variety of commercially important biomolecules. Successful evolution requires the efficient exploration of sequence space to locate molecules encoding the desired properties. Previous methods of introducing diversity include whole-genome mutagenesis, error-prone PCR, random cassette mutagenesis, and DNA shuffling. Of these, only DNA shuffling allows the recombination of parent DNA sequences, but it is still limited to recombination at sites of homology between sequences.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:The nonhomologous random recombination (NRR) method allows portions of nucleic acids to be recombined at sites where there is little or no sequence homology. This increases the frequency at which novel sequences are generated, allowing a more efficient and complete exploration of nucleic acid and protein diversity. NRR is a simple method that diversifies proteins in ways that are difficult or impossible to achieve by existing methods. Studies have shown that NRR could drive the production of hybrid enzymes with activity greater than those hybrids formed by traditional DNA shuffling. The implementation of protein NRR is straightforward, enabling starting DNA to be converted into a diversified library in about 1 day. In addition to applications for evolving proteins, NRR is useful for evolving nucleic acids with catalytic or binding (aptamer) activities.Comparison of diversification methods for nucleic acid evolution  Starting with parental sequences, pure SELEX enriches active sequences. Error-prone PCR yields parental sequences with point mutations. Homologous recombination methods, such as DNA shuffling, allow crossovers between sequences only in regions of homology. Nonhomologous random recombination allows many other changes, including random crossovers between any sequences, repetition, reordering, reorienting, elimination of subsequences, or any combination of these changes.The NRR method for proteins  One or more parental genes are digested with DNase I. Fragments are blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase, size-selected, and ligated under conditions that favor intermolecular ligation. Two hairpin sequences are added in a defined stoichiometry to the ligation reaction to generate recombined products of the desired average size. The ends of the hairpins are removed by restriction digestion, and the PCR-amplified pool is cloned for protein expression and selection."," Genomics/Proteomics","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=1885","Rene Castro, (617) 495-3663","Harvard University"

They outsource the hardware production and assembly to large-scale contract manufacturers overseas for cost reduction. This poses a big security threat to the military and business world because Trojans can be embedded in the integrated circuit (IC) products with the malicious purpose of stealing highly classified information. However, detecting Trojans is very difficult and often impractical as it may require costly destructive inspection of the circuit. A group of Harvard electrical engineers led by Prof. H. T. Kung has found a solution to this problem. Named DISTROY, this new approach can detect Trojans by spotting power consumption anomalies in the IC with reduced I/O requirement. DISTROY is a non-destructive way to detect Trojans and should be useful for sensitive military and commercial applications.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Trojans are dormant most of the time, but when they are awake, they draw very small amount of power. This power anomaly can be used as an indication of the existence of Trojans. DISTROY relies on a statistical technique called compressive sensing to enable simple encoding and accurate reconstruction of the most significant power consumption anomalies. The team at Harvard applies N test vectors (or circuit inputs) to the circuit under test, obtaining N power measurements. These measurements are then compared to the expected values computed based on the Log-normal leakage current model. The discrepancies from the comparison reveal whether or not Trojans are present. DISTROY is based on the premise that circuit states in which the Trojan background power consumption stands out are sparse, thus allowing the use of compressive sensing at substantially reduced I/O requirements. This technique can efficiently and reliably detect Trojans that consume very small background power."," Semiconductors  |   Software/Algorithms  |   Electrical Engineering","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=4227","Sam Liss, (617) 495-4371","Harvard University"

"2905","Licensable Technology","DNA nanotube liquid crystals for NMR structure determination","Chou, James J.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:NMR is currently used in support of structure-based drug design,  in which the 3-D structure of a drug target interacting with small molecules is used to guide drug discovery. NMR is also used upstream in the drug discovery process to determine how a new drug will bind with its target molecule, optimizing leads, and as a component of the screening process. NMR spectroscopy sales are estimated at $350-400 million annually. Demand for drug discovery applications is estimated to grow at an average of 10% per year.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Scientists at the Harvard Medical School and the Dana-Farber Cancer institute have discovered how to make DNA nanotubes of a uniform length that will self-assemble into liquid crystals.  A solution comprising liquid crystalline DNA nanotubes is resistant to detergent and enables liquid-crystal NMR spectroscopy of membrane proteins solubilized in detergent. The DNA nanotube liquid crystans can be manufactured on a large-scale to achieve economies of scale, and then sold in aliquots to solution NMR spectroscopists across the world interested in solving the structure of clinically-relevant membrane proteins that can be the focus of structure-based drug design. With current NMR technology it is quite difficult to analyze membrane proteins because membrane-embedded proteins are not readily amenable to existing crystallization methods. Solution NMR can be used to obtain structural information without the need for crystallization – but this requires that proteins are solubilized in detergents. This limits the practicality of this approach to relatively small membrane associated proteins. It is believed that ~30% of all expressed polypeptides are membrane associated, and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels, which are integral membrane proteins, comprise more thant 50% of human drug targets. This invention makes possible the accurate measurement of residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) for a wide array of detergent solubilized proteins. This will facilitate the de novo NMR structure determination of large membrane proteins that cannot be determined using current techniques. This could potentially extend the size limit for solution-NMR based structure determination of membrane proteins – making it possible to determine the structures of larger membrane proteins that are good drug targets."," ","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=2905","Grant Zimmermann, (617) 495-3067","Harvard University"

Biofeedback can train people to consciously regulate autonomic functions such as heart rate, skin conductance, and bowel and bladder function and has even allowed individuals to modulate higher-level unconscious biological processes such as pain, athletic performance, and anxiety. Biofeedback can be used to affect neurological function, in a technique called neurofeedback. Neurofeedback has typically been practiced through the use of electroencephalogram (EEG) signal information to condition the desired response, but more recently, technological improvements have allowed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to replace EEG as the basis of the feedback signal. Real-time analysis of fMRI signals affords high spatial and temporal resolution that can improve the efficacy of neurofeedback. The present invention involves administration of therapeutic agents that enhance neurotransmission to improve the efficacy of fMRI mediated neurofeedback learning.
     Potential Commercial Uses: The invention can be used to treat a variety of psychiatric or neurological disorders. By choosing for the fMRI scan an area of the brain known to be involved in a particular disorder, the invention can be used to treat traumatic stress disorders, panic disorders, phobias, generalized anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, as well as cognitive disorders.

Binding of TMR, a cell-permeable small molecule, induces a conformation change, and the RNA transcriptional activation domain displays 10-fold higher activity which increases transcription of the target gene. The method of generating aptamers to a protein target of interest and appending a small molecule binding aptamer may serve as a general approach to creating small molecule-dependent regulators of biological function in living cells."," Drug Discovery Tools","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=2163","Rene Castro, (617) 495-3663","Harvard University"

The inventors have developed a novel PET-FDG imaging method (fPET) which provides temporal information about glucose utilization, using concepts similar to those used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Traditionally, FDG-PET imaging is performed by obtaining an average value of glucose utilization over the length of the entire scan. The new technique, fPET, captures quantitative glucose utilization information over time, providing information about changes in glucose metabolism over time or in response to different experimental conditions. fPET can be performed simultaneously with fMRI, enabling direct comparisons between glucose utilization, hemodynamics, and oxygen consumption in the brain.

Applications:
- Characterization of functional changes in glucose utilization during brain activity using multi-task within-subject designs, such as during sensory and cognitive paradigms (visual, auditory, working memory) or during physiological paradigms (e.g. hypercapnia, hypoxia).
- Investigation of neurovascular and neurometabolic coupling.

"20727","Licensable Technology","Echo-oximeter Device","Subramaniam, Balachundhar ; Bouma, Brett E.; Tearney, Guillermo J.; Li, Li ; Warger, Bill C.; Simon, Brett A.","Technology:
The Tearney lab has developed a minimally device for measuring pulmonary artery oxygen saturation, the Echo-oximeter Device.  Mixed venous oxygen saturation, measured from the pulmonary artery is an important dynamic, real-time indicator of perfusion, cardiac output, oxygenation, and hemoglobin, all of which are important metrics in the surgical and acute care environments. Pulmonary artery catheters (i.e. Swan Ganz catheters) have the ability to provide these measurements. These pulmonary artery catheters are undesirable, however, due to their invasiveness and the fear of increased morbidity associated with these devices. As a result, there is an unmet clinical need for a minimally invasive, safe device to measure mixed venous oxygen saturation. 

The Tearney lab developed a minimally invasive technique that uses photoacoustic generation to measure oxygen saturation in the pulmonary artery. The device is an esophageal catheter that generates a light pulse that is absorbed by blood. When the pulse is absorbed, the blood heats transiently, giving off ultrasound radiation that can be detected as a function of distance from the catheter using an ultrasound transducer. Because oxygenated and deoxygenated blood absorb differently at different wavelengths of light, multiple distinct pulses, each at different wavelengths, can be used to recover the oxygen saturation of the blood in the pulmonary artery. Because of its minimally invasive features, this device will likely change the standard of care for pulmonary artery oxygen saturation measurements in the surgical and critical medicine settings.

"CCMC   2460","Licensable Technology","Efficient and specific gene knockdown by siRNAs produced in bacteria","Lieberman, Judy","siRNAs are an indispensable tool to investigate gene function in eukaryotic cells and may be used for therapeutic purposes to knock down genes implicated in disease. Most siRNAs have been produced by chemical synthesis. Researchers at Boston Children’s have developed a simple method to produce highly potent recombinant siRNAs in Escherichia coli using methods accessible to any laboratory capable of producing recombinant proteins. This method relies on ectopic expression of p19, an siRNA-binding protein found in a plant virus. When expressed in E. coli, p19 stabilizes ~21-nt siRNAs produced by bacterial RNase III (“prokaryotic siRNAs”). siRNAs generated in bacteria expressing p19 and a hairpin RNA encoding 200 or more nucleotides of a target gene contain multiple sequences from the target gene sequence. Prokaryotic siRNAs can be easily purified from bacterial lysates using methods that could be adapted for large scale fermentation. When mammalian cells are transfected with low nanomolar concentrations of prokaryotic siRNAs, target gene knockdown is reproducibly reduced by ~90% without immunogenicity or off-target effects. Because bacterially produced siRNAs contain multiple sequences against a target gene, they may be especially useful for suppressing polymorphic cellular or viral genes.||

Given that the human genome has 50,000-100,000 genes, this is a severe limitation.  It is likely that unknown mutations and polymorphisms in several other genes both known and unknown, exist simultaneously with mutations/polymorphisms in the ?gene of interest.?  However, mutations in those other genes would likely not be identified.

A researcher at the Dana-Farber has discovered a method that permits the rapid identification of mutations in a DNA segment or in any mixture of DNA segments (genes).  This method comprises identifying mismatches that occur when a target nucleic acid strand is hybridized to a control nucleic acid sequence.  Thereafter, by known techniques determining whether that mismatch is a mutation that either causes the disorder or is associated with the disorder or simply an allelic variation, i.e. a polymorphism.

"03246","Licensable Technology","EGF SNP Predicts Risk of Hepatocellular Carcinoma","Fuchs, Bryan; Tanabe, Kenneth K.; Kawasaki, Hiroshi","Technology
Chronic liver can lead to fibrosis, which ultimately leads to cirrhosis and liver failure. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common solid tumor worldwide and cirrhosis is the strongest risk factor for HCC, particularly cirrhosis related to hepatitis C and hepatitis B virus infections. Currently therapies for HCC are limited and most diagnoses are made at late stages of the disease. Early identification of persons at high risk for HCC is vital for targeted screening and chemoprevention to be effective. Current screening methods are limited to abdominal ultrasound imaging of patients with cirrhosis, and those with chronic hepatitis B regardless of cirrhosis. 

A G61A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the EGF gene has been identified for its association with higher EGF levels and an increased risk of HCC. Subjects with genotype G/G have a higher risk for HCC, than those with genotype A/A (adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity, smoking status, and fibrosis score). In a study of about 1000 HCV-cirrhosis patients, this SNP accounted for the discrepancy in HCC risk observed between black and white populations. 

Applications:
- Detection of disease in hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis patients, before progression to HCC
-Increased monitoring, earlier treatment of at-risk patients; better clinical outcomes.

Advantages:
-Large market of up to 10 million people with fibrosis worldwide
-Potentially the first molecular diagnostic for HCC, liver fibrosis and/or cirrhosis
- Patient stratification for clinical trials of new drugs targeting liver cancers.

Chronic hepatitis virus infections and chemotherapy-induced liver disease can lead to fibrosis, which ultimately leads to cirrhosis, liver failure and/or hepatocellular cancer (HCC). Dr. Tanabe's lab in the Division of Surgical Oncology at Massachusetts General Hospital showed in rat and mouse models of cirrhosis that treatment with the EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib, results in prevention of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, in the reversal of fibrosis in some animals, improvement of liver function tests, and the prevention of progression to HCC. A gene signature of cirrhosis severity and HCC was also reversed by erlotinib.
This represents a new use for the class of EGFR inhibitors, including FDA-approved drugs such as Erlotinib/Tarceva and Gefitinib/Iressa, as well as new drugs in development. A SNP molecular diagnostic for identification of patients at higher risk for HCC has also been developed and may be used as a companion diagnostic in patient stratification for the clinical trials. The gene signature (developed with the Broad Institute) may be used to monitor the effect of therapy.
Applications:
- Treatment of hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis in patients with chronic liver diseases such as chronic viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, or chemotherapy-induced liver diseases.
- Prevents progression from fibrosis/cirrhosis to HCC; Improved clinical outcomes

Wi-Fi networks based on the 802.11 set of standards are pervasive, but have a fundamental performance bottleneck that limits the practical number of active users on a network. The existing protocol is based on a random access method and has limitations, such as traffic congestion and the difficulty of implementing quality-of-service (i.e. prioritization). A team of Harvard researchers, led by Professor H. T. Kung, developed a solution to these limitations; a new protocol based on a compressive sensing statistical method. This protocol takes a centralized approach to the problem, thus enabling efficient scheduling among a number of hosts and easing the implementation of quality-of-service. The invention can also coexist with current 802.11-based products.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:The new protocol, compressive sensing medium access control (CS-MAC), takes advantage of the sparse property of a system, and has demonstrated its capability to acquire and extract critical information efficiently. For a system with a number of hosts, CS-MAC sets up a central coordinator to collect host requests compressively and make multiple grants simultaneously. Concurrent requests from several hosts can be combined in the air with only a few compressive measurements. On the other hand, current established 802.11 standards take a random access approach. Because the lack of a central coordinator, requests from different hosts are competing with each other, resulting in traffic congestion. And it is also difficult to prioritize resources to different users and applications. CS-MAC overcomes these two major problems while maintaining low computational complexity. The protocol overhead for CS-MAC is shown to be comparable to basic 802.11 DCF when amortized over multiple packets. Thanks to its efficient scheduling capability, CS-MAC is especially attractive in large-scale distributed systems."," Software/Algorithms  |   Networking/Communications  |   Software/Algorithms  |   Networking/Communications","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=4249","Sam Liss, (617) 495-4371","Harvard University"

A subgroup of patients with Lyme arthritis, a tick-borne spirochetal infection, have persistent synovitis for months or even several years after spirochetal eradication with antibiotic therapy, called antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis. This results from infection induced autoimmunity within affected joints. The inventors have identified an autoantigen, platelet derived endothelial cell growth factor (ECGF) in the synovial fluid of affected joints of these patients. An ELISA diagnostic assay has been developed to detect ECGF autoantigen-binding autoantibodies in serum and ECGF protein in synovial fluid, which allows the clinician to appropriately identify these patients and treat this disease. Currently a number of patients are being continuously treated with antibiotics for months and years, by using this diagnostic test they could be possibly switched to an appropriate anti-rheumatic/anti-inflammatory therapy. 

Applications:
1.	A diagnostic assay to rapidly identify chronic lyme disease (CLD) patients with antibiotic refractory Lyme arthritis.
2.	More effective treatment regimens can be developed for CLD patients who had prolonged illness and an associated lower quality of life.


Advantages:
1.	The assay is highly sensitive and specific.
2.	Convenient, cost-effective, faster than available PCR Borrelia burgdorferi DNA tests in synovial fluids. 
3.	Improve treatment to patient; avoid costly and ineffective antibiotic therapy.
4.	Tests can be offered by CLIA lab to clinicians.
5.	Format of assay: ELISA, agglutination test, direct immunoflourescence assay, indirect immunofluorescence assay, western blot, and the immunoblot.

These fluorinated amino acid building blocks can be used directly in solid phase peptide synthesis to form non-natural peptides with superior thermal stability and denaturant resistance compared to their natural analogs.  Fluorinated amino acids can also act as enzyme inhibitors, and may be useful as pharmaceutical agents.Background Selective fluorination of biologically active compounds is often accompanied by dramatic changes in physiological activity.  Fluorinated amino acids are being investigated as pharmaceutical compounds and enzyme inhibitors.  Proteins and peptides whose hydrophobic residues are selectively replaced with fluorinated amino acids show promise as industrial enzymes and pharmaceutical proteins with enhanced stability.Many of the unique properties of fluorinated compounds derive from their unusually strong self-affinity.  Selective fluorination of amino acids can thus provide a specific protein-protein interaction that is both hydrophobic and lipophobic, and may allow fluorinated peptides to fold properly in aqueous and organic solvents, as well as within the lipid bilayer of cell membranes.  Fluorinated proteins display an overall increased folding strength, so they are more heat and denaturant resistant than their natural counterparts. Use of single enantiomer amino acids is crucial for fluorinated peptide synthesis, where incorporation of a single residue with opposite chirality has been shown to greatly destabilize the resulting peptide.  Single enantiomer syntheses are also desirable for pharmaceutical agents, since often only one enantiomer of a chiral compound displays the desired biological activity.AdvantagesThe current invention introduces the first non-racemic synthesis of hexafluoroleucine, producing the final product in greater than 99% enantiomeric excess.  Amino acids synthesized by this method are produced in the Boc-protected form, allowing them to be used directly in solid phase peptide synthesis.

Problems encountered to date include the need for patients to permanently take immunosuppressive drugs, which may entail serious side effects. Microencapsulation has been used for full or partial protection of transplanted islets from immune rejection, however, the use of microcapsules in general prevents islet revascularization and serves as a barrier to optimal oxygen transport to the islets. Reduced oxygen transfer can lead to a hypoxic core within the islet that results in tissue death and reduced function. The present invention solves this problem by providing a preparation with enhanced islet survival and function without unduly limiting oxygen transport to the cells. The invention features aggregated pancreatic islet cells encapsulated in a biocompatible matrix, into which a material has been dispersed which aids in oxygen transport to the cells. This material is known to have favorable oxygen transport properties, but has not previously been used or investigated for islet transplantation. Islets encapsulated in such a matrix were viable in low oxygen concentrations, and were capable of reversing the diabetic phenotype when implanted in an animal model of the disease.

Endostatin is an N-terminal fragment of collagen XVIII, and is a naturally occuring molecule that operates by shutting down multiple biochemical pathways involved in neovascularization, particularly (though not exclusively) the neovascularization that supports tumor growth in cancer. Dr. Folkman's pioneering hypothesis that cancer can be effectively treated by inhibiting neovascularization has been validated by the FDA's approval of Genentech's Avastin.  In model systems, Endostatin has demonstrated efficacies in significant additional indications. ||

The compound was licensed to EntreMed, Inc. in the mid 1990s. EntreMed developed a production method and full pre-clinical packages, filed INDs, and initiated Phase I and Phase II clinical trials. Trials demonstrated a complete absence of any measurable toxicity. Prior to the start of these trials, the enrolled patients were diagnosed with terminal disease and had substantial tumor burdens.  However, their tumors did not grown substantially in one year or more. After a change in corporate strategy, EntreMed returned the rights to Endostatin to Children's Hospital Boston in 2004. Rational design of new and/or broadened clinical trials requires additional preclinical work to more effectively target tumor types and patients, validate more effective surrogate end-points to measure clinical effect, and implement and verify a more effective manufacturing release assay than those used previously.

At 50 µM, neamine abolishes angiogenin-induced proliferation but does not affect the basal level of proliferation and cell viability. Other aminoglycoside antibiotics have no effect on angiogenin-induced cell proliferation. Neamine completely inhibits angiogenin-induced angiogenesis in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane at a dose as low as 20 ng per egg. In athymic mice, xenograft tumor growth is significantly inhibited. Continuing study of the underlying mechanism of angiogenin inhibition is under way at Harvard. A unique knowledge base and infrastructure is employed in these studies.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Angiogenin is an extensively validated target involved in tumor angiogenesis. Angiogenin is prominently increased in multiple cancer cell types, including, prostate, colon, bladder, gastric, brain, cervical, pancreatic, ovarian and breast cancers as well as melanoma and leukemias, and its serum level is elevated in patients affected by several of these cancer types. Angiogenin was validated in animals via multiple approaches, including inhibition by mAbs, antisense, RANi and several types of small molecules. A class of angiogenesis inhibitors has emerged from Vallee and Hu's mechanistic study of the action of angiogenin. Neomycin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, and neamine, a non-toxic neomycine derivative, inhibit nuclear translocation of human angiogenin in human endothelial cells. Translocation into the nucleus was demonstrated to be an essential step for angiogenin-induced angiogenesis. In addition, inhibition of translocation blocks the induction of rRNA transcription, a rate-limiting step in ribosome biogenenesis, normally mediated by Angiogenin. More importantly, neamine inhibits growth of PC-3 human prostate tumor cells in athymic mice. These results suggest that neamine and other neomycin analogs are a class of agents that may be developed for anti-angiogenin therapy."," Therapeutics - Drugs","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=2580","Michal Preminger, (617) 432-0920","Harvard University"

"CCMC   2985","Licensable Technology","Engineered Antibody Class Switch Recombination","Chiarle, Roberto","Class switch recombination (CSR) occurs during the normal maturation of B-cells. The initial step of CSR is the binding of an antigen to the B-cell surface-expressed immunoglobulin (Ig) H. Provided that the proper cytokines are present, antigen binding sets off a sequence of biological events that eventually lead to different mature B-cell populations each displaying or secreting antibodies of different classes. These classes reflect changes in the constant region of the antibody while the variable (antigen binding) region remains unaltered. The different classes of antibodies elicit differential interactions between host factors and the variable constant regions permitting the immune system to respond to the same antigen through distinct mechanisms. However, inducing CSR in vitro is time consuming, sometimes requiring multiple sequential B-cell cultures in the presence of different cytokines. ||

Roberto Chiarle’s group at Boston Children’s Hospital has developed an alternative approach to inducing CSR. Instead of the traditional cytokine B-cell culture approach, Chiarle’s group has employed CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology and guide RNA molecules designed to induce specific class changes. These class changes can be induced in both naïve B-cells and hybridoma without the need for time-consuming and expensive cell cultures in a sequence of conditions. In addition to the CSR work, the researchers also successfully induced Fab fragment production in B-cells and hybridoma. Together, this set of methods allows straightforward, one-step approaches to manipulate antibodies and their classes for therapeutic and research purposes. The techniques and reagents developed by Chiarle’s group are ideally positioned to deliver significant gains in the workflow efficiency of antibody providers."," Research Tools  |   Research Reagents  |   Therapeutics - Drugs","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=2985","Caron, Connie, connie.caron@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"

"UMD 07-05","Licensable Technology","Enhanced Surface Cooling of Thermal Discharges","Daniel MacDonald","Enhanced Surface Cooling (ESC) is a cost-effective way to minimize the negative impact from industrial discharges of waste heat into a poorly flushed natural water body. The method improves direct heat transfer to the atmosphere, thereby limiting environmental impact to the receiving water body. The method is applicable for heat discharges from power plants and other industrial facilities.

Electric utilities generally depend on the use of cooling water throughout the power generation cycle. There are generally two approaches to remove waste heat from a power plant’s operation. The more expensive method is to employ a cooling tower, which allows heat to evaporate through steam into the atmosphere. The alternative, less expensive option is to discharge the heated water directly to a body of water, often the original source body of water. However, the recycled water has been heated to a high temperature in its cooling role, and discharge of this heated water can negatively impact the environment through thermal pollution, especially where there is no steady flow of replacement water.

This invention provides a new method for waste heat discharges into poorly flushed water bodies. The prevailing wisdom in the design and construction of outfalls is often summed up by the adage “the solution to pollution is dilution”, with most existing outfalls designed to mix the discharged effluent as effectively as possible with the ambient receiving waters. This is not, however, the best method for waste heat discharges in all cases. Heat is different from other contaminants in that it is readily transferred across the surface of the water body to the overlying air mass through a variety of mechanisms. In cases where there is a limited replacement of water within the receiving water body, efficient mixing only serves to move heat away from the surface and into longer-term storage at depth. In these cases, it is more efficient to limit mixing, and to spread the discharging fluid in a thin layer across the surface in order to take advantage of the natural air-water heat exchange mechanisms. A reduction in effluent mixing can be accomplished through specific modifications to outfall design. 

Among the benefits of the technology are: 
-- Increased heat transfer across water surface, reducing overall heat load stored in receiving water body. 
-- Reduced overall surface area and volume impact of heat discharge to receiving water body by as much as 90%.
-- Localization of environmental impact to the surface layer of the body of water.
-- Required modifications to intake structures can reduce entrainment of eggs and larvae.
-- Significant cost savings over closed cycle alternatives, such as cooling towers.
 
This technology could be of value to companies that provide waste water treatment equipment and/or services to utility companies, or to the utilities themselves. This technology is the subject of an allowed U.S. patent application."," Environment  |   Civil Engineering","http://www.umassd.edu/research/otcv/inventionsavailableforlicencing","David J.

This field of endeavor is exploding rapidly as the technical barriers are being overcome. Although various chemically defined media for growing hES are being evaluated, the most efficient and viable way to culture hES cells such that they remain pluripotent is utilizing feeder cells. Cells used most commonly are mouse embryo fibroblast (“MEF”) cells. Disadvantages with MEF cells, however, are that hES cells are difficult or impossible to maintain in the pluripotent state, difficult to grow, and -- since MEF cells are not immortal -- the cells tend to be variable and remain poorly characterized. Similar issues have been reported with feeder cell lines of human origin. Because of the robust and immortal nature of the MMM cell line, quality control studies that require culture reproducibility are feasible which will potentially pave the way for use in human subjects. In addition, the research market for feeders that can support pluripotent hES cells is significant.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Dr. Howard Green is world renowned for having developed the first use of cultured cells as therapeutics - keratinocytes for the regeneration of epidermis on severely burned patients. Recently, Dr. Green’s group has developed an immortalized cell line, known as MMM, which grows robustly and efficiently supports propagation of hES cells in culture.The MMM line is a unique cell line derived from fibroblasts of 12-13 day old mouse embryos.  After 24 serial subcultures, the line became established (immortalized).  It is robust and grows very rapidly (Td=16 hours).  It is very effective in supporting the growth of human embryonic stem (hES) cells.  The MMM line has been made resistant to blasticidin and zeocin, which are the most efficient drugs available for selection of hES cells transfected with exogenous genes.MMM cells were found to be superior to the commonly used MEFs for the maintenance of stem cell character of the hES line H9 when cocultivated (Iuchi et al., Differentiation, 74: 160, 2006).  In addition, the hES line known as H1, which is very difficult to grow on MEFs, has been demonstrated to be serially cultivatable on MMM cells. The H1 cells are able to grow very well, and retain the stem cell property of pluripotentiality, as shown by the retention of nuclear Oct4 (Photo 1).  The well-circumscribed borders of these colonies can also be seen by Differential Interference Contrast Microscopy (Photo 2).The significant advantages of MMM cells for support of hES cells include –•     Indefinite lifespan (immortalized); •     Rapid growth rate;•     Better support of hES cells than MEFs;•     Excellent ability to support growth of difficult-to-grow hES lines, with maintenance of the pluripotential state;•     Their resistance to blasticidin and zeocin makes it possible to select, by drug treatment, for hES cells into which exogenous genes have been introduced, without killing the supporting MMM"," ","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=2533","Alan Gordon, (617) 384-5000","Harvard University"

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can functionally regenerate an ablated hematopoietic system, and bone marrow and peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation are therapeutic approaches that are increasingly used for the treatment of leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, breast and ovarian cancers, and genetic disorders affecting hematopoietic cell function. Mobilizing agents such as Amgen’s Neupogen (GC-SF) or Neulasta (pegylated GC-SF) are often given to transplant donors to enhance the number of HSCs which can be obtained for transplantation. A newer, drug, Mozobil, is in Phase III trials for this indication, and with worldwide sales estimates for the drug as high as $200-300 million, its prospects recently led to the acquisition of its developer AnorMed by Genzyme, following a protracted bidding war. The present invention is based on the inventors’ discovery that a particular zinc-finger transcription factor regulates both HSC expansion and mobilization processes. In particular, in transgenic mice lacking one or both copies of the gene for this factor, LT-HSCs were found in significantly greater frequency in both bone marrow and peripheral blood.

The invention comprises methods and compositions for modulating HSC expansion and mobilization by targeting this zinc-finger factor. For example, the invention includes a method of increasing the number of hematopoietic stem cells in the peripheral blood of a subject, by administering to the subject an effective amount of an inhibitor of this particular zinc finger transcription factor.

The migration of eosinophils into wounds or other inflamed sites results in tissue damage and delayed healing. At the same time, eosinophil influx into sites of tumor cell growth is a favorable prognostic indicator. Eotaxin-based compositions, diagnostic- and drug-screening assays and therapeutic methods are directed at inflammatory, respiratory and malignant diseases, including Crohn's Disease, ulcerative colitis, cystic fibrosis, asthma, allergy, parasitic infections, wound healing and cancer. Unlike globally-active chemokines, eotaxin may be modulated with low risk of side effects.  This versatile invention offers animal and in vitro models for the assay of eotaxin modulators in drug discovery methods.

If the charge level is above a predetermined threshold the charge in the triggering charge packet and in the charge packets from neighboring pixels need to be measured accurately. A charge delay register is included in the event-driven X-ray CCD imager device to enable recovery of the charge packets from neighboring pixels for accurate measurement.

However, scientists at the Broad Institute have developed ChIP methods through the construction and purification of a sequencing library that not only show superior yield, comparability and sensitivity to trace proteins, but can be fully automated for high throughput screening —an improvement previously blocked by the hands-on time required for existing ChIP protocols. The improvements open the door to scaled-up use of ChIP to screen large numbers of samples in parallel. This advancement will enable better chromatin-protein mapping and improve the opportunity to develop therapeutic and diagnostic programs. Further expanding ChIP’s reach, Broad scientists have also developed control agents for ChIP assays. These agents are a collection of peptide-oligo conjugates which can be annealed into the experiment and undergo all the process steps in parallel to the genomic material.

This is a proprietary process that uses one known shRNA sequence for promoting hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self renewal and expansion as adjunct therapy for hematological diseases.  
	
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a life-saving procedure for hematopoietic malignancies, marrow failure syndromes, and immunodeficiency disorders. However, the limited number of HSCs from common donor sources, such as HLA-matched bone marrow and umbilical cord blood, is associated with the high risk of this procedure. Further, there are no products on the market currently for expansion of HSCs. 
	
Inventors have shown that ex vivo expansion of human HSCs by this specific shRNA resulted in a dramatic (>50%) increase in repopulation activity in transplantation assays -  which is 5 fold more than increases by other methods. This shRNA could be used to (i) expand patient specific HSCs ex vivo or in vivo and (ii) to expand HSCs ex vivo from alternate limited sources, e.g. umbilical cord blood, for HSC transplant applications.    
	
The shRNA can also be used in vivo for reconstitution of the blood system and may be more potent than current available treatments.   

Application:	
Use in conjunction with treatments for various hematological diseases, including (i) leukemia (ii) myelodysplastic syndrome and (iii) anemia, or any disease treated by bone marrow transplantation.

Advantages:  
May make HSC transplantations more widely applicable for various hematological diseases."," Therapeutic","http://www.partners.org/techtransfer/availabletechnologies/default.asp","Seema Basu, ssbasu@partners.org, (617) 954-9337","Massachusetts General Hospital"

Consequently, compromised vascular barrier function contributes to or complicates many life-threatening pathological conditions including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, organ failure, cancer, and atherosclerosis. To address this challenge, researchers in the Ingber lab have discovered that vascular leakage can be controlled by altering extracellular matrix (ECM) structure using chemicals or biologics, and therefore can be manipulated in a clinically impactful manner. ||

The Ingber lab has discovered that physical changes in the ECM directly impact cell-cell junctions and vascular permeability, and they have demonstrated that the ECM is mechanically stiffer in disease conditions, such as pulmonary edema and cancer, where increased vascular leakage is observed.  Importantly, they showed that by increasing the flexibility of these abnormally stiffened ECMs, for example, by inhibiting collagen cross-linking with chemical modulators, they can normalize vascular barrier function.  Moreover, they used this approach to prevent endotoxin-induced pulmonary edema in an animal model. The same approach could potentially be used to alter drug delivery across vascular barriers."," Therapeutics - Drugs  |   Diagnostics/Biomarkers","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=2520","Dietz, Ryan, ryan.dietz@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"

While this traditional setup works well in many situations, the length and handling of the needles and sutures present challenges in confined spaces. Direct manipulation of both the needle holder and tweezers are necessary to prevent the accidental puncturing of neighboring tissues. Researchers at Boston Children’s Hospital have invented a novel, enabling stitching apparatus that utilizes a very short, hollow, magnetic needle. Depending on the thickness of the tissue to be pierced, the length of the needle can be <5mm. It is designed to reduce the size of surgical field, reduce tissue injury, and improve surgical outcomes. ||

The stitching mechanism is simple and rapid. First, the needle component is pierced through the tissue. Next, the needle magnetically engages a suture element (which also has a magnetic end) into the hollow space within the beveled section. Finally, the needle is pulled in the opposite direction it was inserted, pulling the magnetically engaged suture through the tissue."," Medical Devices","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=2607","Yen, Alan, alan.yen@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"
"UMD 07-03","Licensable Technology","Fabric Based Laminar Composite and Method for Manufacture Thereof","Yong Kim et al.","Layered fabric-reinforced composites are being increasingly sought for use in impact resistance materials (e.g. body armor). However, such materials generally have the structural drawback of poor interlaminar shear strength, with little or no fiber reinforcement in the thickness (Z-axis) direction, so that these materials have less inter-ply strength than longitudinal strength, which can result in poor impact and/or interlaminar flexural fatigue strength. A number of techniques have been used in the past to increase interlaminar strength of layered composite materials, but these methods are difficult to implement on a commercial level for a number of reasons (cost, time, manufacturing difficulties, etc.). This invention overcomes this problem by the creation of a “reinforcement zone” between laminar layers by the flocking of short Z-Axis reinforcing fibers onto individual (uncured) resin impregnated fibrous layers such as woven fabric. Individual flock fiber Z-Axis containing layers can then be assembled one on top of the other to create a so-called “wet lay-up” laminar assembly, and then the resulting reinforced organic polymer organic structure is impregnated with uncured liquid resin and cured in an heated laminating press (or autoclave). The resulting material containing several layers of substrate reinforced by the flocking was found to have dramatically improved interlaminar shear strength and impact resistance.

The current existing techniques to do this range from using viruses or chemicals enveloping the DNA and crossing the cell membrane, to employing mechanical means to inject material directly into a cell’s nucleus, to the more recent advancements in using high intensity lasers to bore holes in cell walls. All of these mentioned techniques have benefits and drawbacks, however a recent advancement made by the Mazur lab using low-intensity lasers and field-enhancing substrates makes it possible to induce membrane poration necessary for material injection into cells in an extremely attractive fashion. The new technology complements the accuracy of traditional laser induced membrane poration by allowing an operator to use some existing laser scanning microscopes in combination with a proprietary substrate to perform a desired cell injection.  When compared to traditional optoinjection techniques, this technique dramatically increases the rate of cells transfected and decreases overall light intensity required for poration, reducing cell death and allowing the use of commonly available equipment.  The technique enables optoinjection for large-scale sample work and manufacture.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:The historical optoinjection technique make use of specialized pulsed lasers. These lasers generate large intensities of light used to porate a target’s cell wall such that foreign material may pass through it. The invention described here utilizes less intense light sources in combination with a field-enhancing substrate to amplify the local optical field intensity to a level such that the intensity threshold for damaging a cell wall is reached at a lower incident laser intensity than is normally required.  This implies that the cells sitting on top of the substrate experience a high intensity at specific points of contact to the underlying substrate.  Using this field-enhancing substrate, many cells may become transiently porous, permitting highly-efficient transfection.  In addition, the laser used for the transfection has a lower intensity requirement than if it were not used in conjunction with the field-enhancing substrate.  This opens up possibilities of performing transfection of cells in large numbers with larger focused spot sizes at high speeds."," Instrumentation  |   Semiconductors  |   Instrumentation  |   Semiconductors  |   Instrumentation  |   Semiconductors  |   Instrumentation","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3466","Alan Gordon, (617) 384-5000","Harvard University"

"20003","Licensable Technology","Feed-back loop Deep Brain Stimulation for the treatment of movement disorder in Parkinson s Disease","Sarma, Sridevi V.; Eskandar, Emad ; Brown, Emery Neal","Technology:  The product is a proprietary device and method to treat tremor in Parkinson s Disease (PD) using Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in a closed feed back loop. DBS requires a surgical procedure in which an electrode is implanted in a targeted brain area, which is connected through a wire to a regulator for long term treatment.  Currently, DBS is successfully applied to treat PD movement disorder in an open loop stimulation mode.  The system replaces drug therapy at late stage disease when drug treatment becomes less effective.  The open loop DBS device sends high power electric stimuli in a periodic pulse to a designated brain area.  Such open loop treatment requires difficult calibration time and can have side effects due to the high power signal and leakage into neighboring brain areas.  The new closed loop system provides a solution to the aforementioned problems by using single unit feed back recordings from DBS microelectrodes that will regulate and control the electric stimuli, to the brain, relating to frequency and power, thereby creating a self-calibrating, personalized therapy.

Application:	Treatment of movement disorder in Parkinson s Disease 
 
Advantages:  
- improving patient lives by 
- reducing side effects like involuntary movements, anxiety, depression, associated with stimulations affecting other brain areas, 
- eliminating cumbersome calibration period (weeks to months), 
- reduction of care costs associated with side effects and device calibration, 
- expansion of DBS market from late-stage to mid-stage disease.

Pathological neovascularization in the retina cause retinopathies such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. At present, there is no cure, the only alternative is the use of invasive procedures consisting mainly in photocoagulation (laser beam to repair leaking blood vessels in the retina), vitrectomy (the surgical removal of the vitreous gel) and the use of VEGF blockers injected into the eye (i.e., Avastin, Lucentis). These invasive procedures results in multiple side effects including some permanent vision loss, mild loss of central vision, reduced night vision, and blocking neuronal stabilization as well as the growth of healthy necessary blood vessels in the eye and at a systemic level.||
Photoreceptors are mitochondria-rich cells with high energy consumption that was thought to rely on glucose as a fuel source. However, Dr. Smith’s team demonstrated that retina also uses fatty acid and identified free fatty acid receptor 1 (Ffar1, also known as GPR40) as a lipid sensor that curbs glucose uptake in presence of lipid abundance. In addition, they showed that when the lipid uptake is defective (extracellular lipid abundance and reduced lipid intake), photoreceptor cells fail to uptake glucose resulting in nutrient scarcity that leads to pathological angiogenesis. Moreover, Ffar1 deficient mice have improved glucose uptake and reduced number of vascular lesions when compared to controls and VLDLR deficient mice with defective lipid uptake. In contrast, Ffar1 agonists prevent glucose uptake and exacerbate the number of vascular lesions in VLDLR deficient mice. Therefore, the data from the research suggest that Ffar1 may be a potential target for therapeutic development and the use of Ffar1 inhibitors could restore metabolic function and prevent pathological vascularization."," Therapeutics - Drugs","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=2800","Meyer, Abbie, abbie.meyer@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"

The ultrasound generator was fabricated by coating several layers of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) on the end face of a piece of commercially available optical fiber via a layer-by-layer (L-b-L) technique. The ultrasound is generated through photoacoustic procedure. By introducing excitation laser pulses on the Au NPs layer, the energy of laser is converted into the heat through photo-thermal mechanism, which then transforms into kinetic energy through thermal-elastic mechanism generating the ultrasound. The experimental results showed that this kind of ultrasound generator shows wide bandwidth, high frequency and miniature size. Comparing to conventional energy absorption materials such as graphite, the Au NPs show high energy absorption efficiency and high thermal expansion rate.

"2616","Licensable Technology","Field effect transistors constructed by coating carbon nanotubes with dielectrics and metals by ALD","Gordon, Roy G.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Since their discovery over a decade ago, carbon nanotubes have been the subject of intense study because of their unique electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties. They have been proposed as the basis of new sensors, nanoscale electrical circuits, molecular delivery systems, photonic sources, thermal conductors, mechanical fibers, chemical catalysts, and as critical components for a wide variety of other applications. A wide range of nanoscale devices and structures can be produced using this invention's non-covalent functionalization technique.  For example, a functionalized carbon nanotube may be coaxially coated with a high-K dielectric layer and a selected conducting layer, to form a surround-gate transistor with large charging energies.  In addition, the single-walled carbon nanotube's(SWCNT) functionalization layer will enable highly customizable coatings (e.g. hydrophilic surfaces for medical application) as well as rapid, templated manufacture of hollow nanotube structures.SWCNTs have remarkable electrical and optical properties that have not yet been extensively commercialized because of difficulties making robust and high quality devices containing them.  One current difficulty is the lack of a good technique for uniformly coating SWCNTs with dielectrics, which is required to make devices such as transistors, while retaining the SWCNTs remarkable electrical and optical properties.  Atomic layer deposition (ALD), a promising technique for making thin films for next generation chips, has previously not been available for coating SWCNTs because their surface is not receptive to ALD precursors.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:The invention solves this problem, allowing SWCNTs to be uniformly coated with dielectrics using ALD. With its exquisite control over the thickness and conformality of the coating, the technique allows the formation of coaxial coatings. The technique involves the use of a compound such as nitrous oxide to adsorb to the SWCNT which gives a surface that is now receptive to ALD precursors. Developed in the lab of Professor Roy Gordon, this technique allows for the deposition of thin films on the surface of nanotubes using atomic layer deposition (ALD) without affecting their electronic properties.  The invention is a key insight into the functionalization of carbon nanotube surfaces, allowing chemical precursors to absorb  to the surface of the nanotube, forming receptor sites  for the deposition of coaxial thin films (dielectrics, metals etc.) by ALD  that are exceptionally thin, continuous, and radially isotropic.  The thin film coatings can be functionalized with binding partners of analytes (i.e., antibody/antigens) to form biosensors.  Coaxial metallic layers can also be deposited on the suspended nanotubes, allowing the fabrication of coaxial field-effect transistors.  The invention opens up the use of SWCNTs as the active heart of transistors for IC chips and for sensors. The inventors have demonstrated the formation of SWCNT transistors using techniques compatible with chip fabrication.  Another potentially valuable finding is that the carbon nanotubes can be oxidized away, leaving behind hollow tubes of the coating layer.  This allows a simple process for forming nanotubes composed of any materials that can be formed by ALD."," Materials  |   Electrical Engineering  |   Drug Discovery Tools  |   Electrical Engineering","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=2616","Mick Sawka, (617) 496-3830","Harvard University"

The original FEAM concept comprises panels in which many short fibers are attached (“flocked”) at one end to a substrate, so that the closely-packed fibers extend away from the substrate in an essentially perpendicular manner. The present invention features different combinations of multiple FEAM layers and fabric, sheet, film, spacer fabric and foam dividers, which form very effective, flexible, fibrous energy managing composite panels. A synergistic effect has been discovered in some FEAM/spacer fabric and FEAM/foam embodiments, namely, that the percentage force losses upon mechanical impact of certain types of combined/layered FEAM/divider composite panels are higher than the percentage force loss of each of the individual components.

Unlike other methods, the method of the invention allows coating of the electroconductive polymer on both sides of the fabric, and is also compatible with the use of delivery systems like ink-jet printers to apply the conductive coating selectively only to desired areas or patterns on the fabric. 

There are many possible applications for fabrics coated with electroconductive polymers. Such coated fabrics add functionality to clothing or other fabrics, for example allowing selective sections to be illuminated, for advertising or other display purposes. Other uses include sensors for environmental contaminants, vapor and humidity sensors, and the creation of antistatic textiles for use in clean rooms or hospitals.  This technology is the subject of a pending U.S. patent application."," Textiles  |   Materials  |   Materials","http://www.umassd.edu/research/otcv/inventionsavailableforlicencing","David J.

"2427","Licensable Technology","FlexVia: A flexible via enabling novel chip designs for memory and optical storage applications","Valenzuela, Sergio Osvaldo","MARKETS ADDRESSED:The technology is broadly applicable in the MEMS/NEMS and semiconductor industry.  Chips produced with the flexible via can be used in place of current technology for CMOS digital logic, solid state memory (DRAM, SRAM, FLASH), hard disks, optical disks (for data storage) and more.  The flexible via addresses several limitations inherent in integrated circuit architectures.  Semiconductor scaling is compromised by the presence of both metallic interconnects and semiconducting elements.  Problems include:          •     High local doping is required, and as devices get smaller the risk is increased that the dopants will diffuse over the active devices.          •     A fast non-volatile memory element is lacking.          •     The different and often incompatible materials (semiconductors, metals) require intricate barrier layers and a large number of mask steps          •     Active elements can be placed only in the bottom layer, resulting in long (and slower) interconnect paths. The FlexVia can address these issues by replacing a vertical via with a nano-electromechanically movable tungsten via.  This movable via can form both a logic switching element and a memory element.   This distributes logic and memory elements in 3D over an integrated circuit, decreasing interconnect path length, increasing IC speed and eliminating complex and costly manufacturing issues by enabling an all metal IC.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Silicon microchips consist of a base layer of silicon with active devices (transistors) in the surface plane. Above it, a complex three dimensional network of horizontal copper interconnects and vertical tungsten plugs connect the active devices together. Antifuses are widely used to permanently program integrated circuits (ICs). ICs that use antifuse technology employ a thin barrier of non-conducting amorphous silicon between two metal conductors. When a sufficiently high voltage is applied across the amorphous silicon it is turned into a polycrystalline silicon-metal alloy with a low resistance, which is conductive, defining a custom circuit after manufacture. Antifuse programmable logic devices are one-time programmable.The FlexVia allows for movable vias (nanomechanical relays) with non-volatile properties. Silicon transistors are thus replaced by active high-speed vias. This way, switches and memory elements can be present in all locations of the 3D circuit, decreasing interconnect path lengths, decreasing dissipation and power, and increasing processor speed. Manufacturing cost is reduced significantly by removing the silicon processing while substrate material choice can be optimized for cost or thermal conductance (e.g. glass or thermally conductive AlN).Electrostatic attraction is used to move the flexible via. Non-volatility is provided by Van der Waals attraction. Low power is achieved by using complementary switches, such that no continuous current flows (similar to CMOS logic).To summarize, key advantages include:          •     High speed: Low ON switch-resistance leads to low RC delays, no ohmic contacts, shorter interconnect paths          •     Low power: Through electrostatics and complementary switching          •     Radiation hard: No charge storage/leakage          •     Wide temperature: operates in a wide temperature range          •     All metal: Ultra Large Scale Integration with metal lines only          •     Cost effective: fewer lithography steps          •     3D integrated: Reduced interconnect complexity due to 3D local presence of logic/memory"," Microelectronics/MEMS  |   Microelectronics/MEMS  |   Microelectronics/MEMS","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=2427","Alan Gordon, (617) 384-5000","Harvard University"

"3928","Licensable Technology","Fluids identification by chemically patterned inverse opal photonic crystals","Aizenberg, Joanna","MARKETS ADDRESSED:3D photonic crystals are of great interest for both fundamental and applied research (e.g. optical computers), but chemically patterned 3D photonic crystals are difficult or impossible to achieve via existing techniques. This invention, by selectively modifying defect-free inverse opal 3D crystal structures with organic molecules, enables the fabrication of chemically functionalized 3D photonic crystal patterns. The high uniformity of the structure and the highly controllable spatial diversity of surface chemistry allows different liquids to wet the material in a highly specific way, and can lead to a variety of applications: 1.     “pH paper”-like colorimetric indicator for organic liquids: a patterned photonic structure strip, able to distinguish between organic liquids with different wetting properties (e.g. various alcohols), can be used to identify different solvents or solvent mixtures.  This is very effective in identifying small spills or unlabelled/abandoned containers that are frequently found in communal lab environments.  The “pH paper”-like optical litmus test can also be used to measure alcohol content (or presence of methanol) of alcoholic drinks or to distinguish between grades of petrol.  2.     Encryption of optical images: encode secret messages in the photonic structures through local surface functionalization. Depending on the number of different functional groups used, different solvent could reveal different messages, with only intended recipient knowing the correct solvent in which to read the message. Upon solvent evaporation, the encoded message disappears and the local structure returns to its original appearance. The envisioned application of the technique includes a multilevel document, art authentication and message encryption. For an example of multilevel encryption, click here.3.     Invisible microfluidic channels: liquids are allowed to confine in and propagate along the chemically modified channels through capillary processes. As the channels are defined with surface functional groups, they can be easily erased and rewritten in different configurations. 4.     Microfluidic channels with fixed configurations and reconfigurable functionality: permanent channels can form by selectively infiltrating material precursors into regions of compatible functionality. These mixing channels can be used as intra-microfluidic chromatography columns for chemical separations, sensors and catalysis.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Professors Joanna Aizenberg and Marko Loncar’s labs have created a unique method to chemically pattern inverse opal silica structures. It starts with the co-assembly of monodisperse colloidal suspension of PMMA nanospheres with silica sol-gel solution onto a substrate, followed by the removal of colloidal particles with heat (for a description of this invention, click here). Next, the SiO2 walls are functionalized with desired molecular groups via silanization. A physical mask covers selected portions of the 3D structure, outside of which the monolayer is etched away and perhaps replaced with other functional groups. This step can be repeated n times and produce (n+1) different 3D chemical patterns in the same photonic crystal.The disclosed technique has exhibited very high selectivity in differentiating liquids with very subtle differences in wetting properties through an easily visible color contrast (see the figures). This technique has proven highly effective in mutually distinguishing many solvents like methanol/ethanol/isopropanol (A), different concentrations of ethanol in water (B), simple alkanes (C, hexane, heptane, octane, nonane, decane), or  different grades of petroleum (D, gasoline/diesel), etc. Furthermore, the chemically patterned 3D structures serve well as the channels in a chip-scale fluidic platform, inherently containing a highly regular porous matrix, in which the functionalized SiO2 surface can guide different liquids in different directions. Notably, all the chemically patterned photonic crystals can be recycled and re-wrote through acid-piranha cleaning or flood exposure to oxygen plasma for long time, completely removing organic functionalities."," Photonics/Optical Systems  |   Materials  |   Photonics/Optical Systems  |   Materials  |   Photonics/Optical Systems  |   Materials","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3928","Mick Sawka, (617) 496-3830","Harvard University"

"20412","Licensable Technology","Fluorescent Zinc Sensor for Detection of Prostate Cancer","Moore, Anna V; Zhang, Xiao-an ; Medarova, Zdravka ; Lippard, Stephen","The Technology:
Inventors at MGH and MIT have developed a fluorescent mobile zinc sensor for the early detection of diseases associated with the disruption of zinc homeostasis, such as prostate cancer. Currently, prostate cancer is diagnosed through digital rectal examination (DRE), which can miss small or remotely-located tumors, and Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) tests. Elevated PSA levels can be caused by factors other than prostate cancer, such as benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), and not all patients with prostate cancer have elevated PSA levels, leading to both high false positives and false negatives from PSA tests. Sensing mobile zinc levels instead of PSA offers a more robust and accurate noninvasive method of diagnosing prostate cancer, as mobile zinc levels are drastically reduced in prostate cancer but increased in BPH. Current methods of detecting zinc require expensive, complex instrumentation, while the novel sensor requires only titration with the sensor media. The novel fluorescent zinc sensor is capable of measuring zinc levels in prostatic secretions with improved accuracy, specificity, convenience, and cost compared to current methods.

Application:
The novel zinc sensor can be used to detect diseases associated with changes in mobile zinc levels, such as prostate cancer. The novel sensor is capable of accurately distinguishing prostate cancer from other related conditions such as benign prostate hyperplasia. The sensor is suitable for use in the clinic or in a self-test setting.

Advantages:
- Specific: Allows for accurate differential diagnosis between prostate cancer and other benign conditions such as benign prostate hyperplasia. 
- Noninvasive: Capable of detecting prostate cancer from prostatic secretions.
- Low cost: Does not require expensive or complicated equipment.
- Convenient: Simple, low-tech methods of use enable clinical or self-test applications.

However, low-frequency (=25 Hz) sinusoidal stimulation (LFSS) can be used to preferentially activate certain cell types without activating passing axons, still eliciting robust responses.  
Applications:
Low frequency sinusoidal stimulation (LFSS) at 5-25 Hz can be used to stimulate neurons in the specific focal areas for stimulation therapy of cochlear implants, retinal and many CNS-based neural prostheses.

To figure out the long-range connections between the many short DNA fragments that next generation sequencers read, scientists rely on ‘jumping libraries.’ But efforts to make libraries with long enough pieces (10-40kb) to produce accurate, high-quality genome assemblies have been stymied by technical hurdles. Now scientists at the Broad Institute have developed new techniques for producing jumping libraries that overcome these hurdles. The invention consists of two new methods, ShARC and Fosill, for making jumping libraries with sufficient long (~40kb) DNA inserts to produce high-quality human genome assemblies using next generation sequencers. The techniques increase the yield of unique 40kb strands with readable end pairs 2 to 5 orders of magnitude over traditional in vitro techniques with the same amount of starting material. In addition, the ends of these 40kb strands can be sequenced using high-speed, low-cost next-generation instruments."," Bioinformatics  |   Bioinformatics  |   Bioinformatics","http://broadinstitute.technologypublisher.com/technology/7133","Terese Dillingham, Licensing Manger: teresed@broadinstitute.org","The Broad Institute, Inc."

More specifically, this technology may prove efficacious in the treatment of poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas, which represents 85% of all primary liver cancers and has a rising global incidence. Fzd2 expression is also correlated with the development of the mesenchymal phenotype in breast, lung, colon, and ovarian cancer cell lines, suggesting a potential role in broader tumor pathogenesis.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:The role of ß-catenin accumulation in the development of tumorigenicity has been well documented to date, with various mutations in ß-catenin, APC, and axin genes typically to blame.  Although ß-catenin accumulation plays a role in hepatocellular carcinoma, mutations in the aforementioned genes are rare. This fact implicates the Wnt signaling pathway in HCC pathogenesis. To date, it has been unknown which Wnt ligands and/or FZD receptors are responsible for the activation of the ß-catenin pathway in HCC. Here, we outline the role of Fzd2 in up-regulation of ß-catenin production and subsequent hepatocellular carcinoma, breast, lung, colon, and ovarian cancer development.Research within the laboratory of Gavin Macbeath in Systems Biology at Harvard Medical School points to the role of the Wnt pathway in ß -catenin accumulation, and Fzd2 specifically as a potential therapeutic target against liver cancer. Research show that Fzd2 knockdowns reduce tumor growth in nude mice, reduction in Fzd2 activity via knockdown or antibody treatment results in reduced metastasis, and anti-Fzd2 treatment causes internalization of cell surface Fzd2 receptors."," Therapeutics - Drugs","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3995","Michal Preminger, (617) 432-0920","Harvard University"

Regardless of specific etiology, it has been found that dopaminergic neurons in the A9 region of the brain (substantia nigra pars compacta) are considerably more vulnerable than dopaminergic neurons in the immediately adjacent A10 region (ventral tegmental area). It is likely that different gene products expressed in the A10 neurons provide a neuroprotective effect. Based on extensive gene expression studies comparing A9 and A10 neurons, the inventors have discovered that elevated levels of the protein G-substrate are neuroprotective of dopaminergic neurons. In vivo rat experiments showed that increasing G-substrate levels in dopaminergic A9 neurons by injection of a viral vector encoding G-substrate resulted in significant neuroprotection of dopaminergic A9 neurons.
     Potential Commercial Uses: This invention features methods for the treatment or prevention of PD by increasing the expression or activity of G-substrate (e.g. introducing G-substrate protein or nucleic acid into the A9 region of the brain) or by similarly modulating certain downstream targets of G-substrate in key signaling pathways.  By identifying a novel target for PD, this invention will lead to safer, more specific, and more powerful treatments for PD, which would be of great importance given the prevalence of this disease in our aging populations. Current therapy for PD, such as the use of the dopamine precursor L-DOPA to replace brain dopamine, has had only limited effectiveness.

The opportunity now exists to exploit this discovery to develop treatments for the treatment insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.Overview:GABA’s role as an endogenous neurotransmitter in the central and peripheral nervous systems has been well studied. Research at Tufts University School of Medicine has led to the discovery that GABA and GABA agonists activate pancreatic islet cell growth by activating the GABAB receptor, thereby serving as an endogenous islet growth factor. Treatment of small islets with GABA or a GABAB receptor agonist, such as baclofen, produces an increase of DNA synthesis.  Additionally, the GABAB receptor antagonist, 2OH-saclofen, and an antibody to the GABAB R1 N-terminus inhibit the mitogen effect of GABA on islets.Applications:GABA and GABA agonists could be used to treat insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus through the regulation and stimulation of growth of insulin-producing islets. The GABAB receptor may also be used for screening purposes, in order to identify novel and proprietary regulators/stimulators of insulin-producing islet cell production. It is also anticipated that this method can also be used for stimulating islet growth (from pre-existing islet or islet neogenesis from ductal tissue) ex vivo after which the cultured islet cells may be used for transplantation purposes.Published US patent application: 20030162754-A1."," ","http://www.tufts.biz/cgi-bin/tech_search.cgi?r=1&case=T001154","John Cosmopoulos617-636-0366john.cosmopoulos@tufts.edu","Tufts University"

"CCMC   2480","Licensable Technology","Gene expression signature that identifies DNA repair and predicts tumor sensitivity to drugs","Szallasi, Zoltan","Genotoxic chemotherapy, one of the most widely-used cancer treatment strategies, forces cells to undergo apoptosis in response to DNA damage. Genotoxic chemotherapy is traditionally most effective in rapidly dividing cancer cells as they rely on high levels of DNA synthesis. Cancer resistance to genotoxic drugs, whether innate or acquired, is one of the major contributing factors in chemotherapy failure. Given the range of side effects attributed to these therapeutics (hair loss, vomiting, increased risk for heart issues and various cancers), it is essential to optimize treatment regimens to include only agents that are known to be effective in treating individual cancers. ||

Researchers at Boston Children’s Hospital hypothesized that genotoxic chemotherapy would also be particularly effective in treating cancers with impaired DNA damage repair pathways. Triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) and BRCA1-associated cancers have abundant genomic aberrations, suggesting a particular susceptibility to DNA damage and potential deficiency in traditional repair pathways. ||

In research led by Dr. Szallasi, nine genes were identified from a single chromosomal region that was significantly associated with platinum sensitivity from two clinical trials on TNBC and ovarian cancer. Two of these genes, BLM and FANCI, are known to be involved in DNA repair mechanisms.  These genes displayed higher expression levels in genotoxic-sensitive tumors. The researchers further demonstrated the specificity of BLM and FANCI expression and genotoxic chemotherapy efficacy by comparing TNBC clinical trials using epirubicin (genotoxic) therapy and taxane (non-genotoxic)-combination therapy. They also studied ovarian cancer trials using the taxane-only therapy group. In trials using genotoxic agents, BLM and FANCI expression was significantly correlated with increased treatment response. In the combination and taxane-only regimens, no significant association was discovered between the expression and treatment response. Therefore, BLM and FANCI present a novel gene expression signature with the ability to predict tumor sensitivity to genotoxic chemotherapy treatment strategies and optimize treatment regimens."," Drug Discovery Tools  |   Diagnostics/Prognostics","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=2480","Yen, Alan, alan.yen@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"

Traditional nanowire integration schemes such as crossover junctions have involved the individual synthesis of nanowires of different compositions or doping.  This synthesis technique allows for fine control over the structure, composition, doping and functionalities of each branch of the nanowire, enabling materials junctions to be integral to the nanostructure.   Heterobranched nanowires have been demonstrated in basic electronic and photonic devices such as diodes, field effect transistors, and light-emitting didoes (LEDs).  More complex nanosystems such as logic circuits, nanocomputers, and 3D biological sensors are possible.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:The bottom-up assembly of nanostructures from individual building blocks offers distinct advantages over traditional top-down fabrication techniques including greatly simplified and cost-effective fabrication and the enablement of unique properties only available at the nanoscale.

This integration is distinct from the assembly of discrete nanowires and allows for unique combinations of materials currently unavailable such as p-n junctions and III-V semiconductors epitaxially integrated with silicon."," Materials  |   Semiconductors  |   Materials  |   Semiconductors  |   Materials","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=2809","Mick Sawka, (617) 496-3830","Harvard University"
"MCL 20164.0","Licensable Technology","Generation of iPS Cells by Direct Protein Delivery","Kwang-Soo Kim, Ph.D., et al.","The field of stem cell biology was revolutionized several years ago by the discovery that differentiated cells, such as adult somatic cells, could be induced to dedifferentiate into a pluripotent state by forcing the expression of genes encoding the transcription factors Oct-3/4, SOX2, c-Myc, and Klf4 (""reprogramming factors"") to reset the cell's genotype to that of a pluripotent state. The resulting cells, called induced pluripotent (""iPS"") cells, are believed to be identical to natural pluripotent stem cells such as embryonic stem cells, with regard to the expression of certain stem cell genes and proteins, potency and differentiability, and other key characteristics. The originally-derived methods for reprogramming differentiated cells require the use of viral vectors to express the reprogramming factor genes, which can be undesirable because viral vectors are known to integrate into host cell genome, possibly causing harm to the cell and the organism. The present invention provides an alternative method of producing iPS cells that avoids such difficulties or disadvantages. In the improved method, purified reprogramming factor proteins are fused (e.g. chemically or through recombinant expression) with a cationic conjugate, such as a lysine-rich peptide, and added to cultures of the desired starting cell. The cationic portion of the hybrid molecule facilitates entry of the proteins into the cells, to allow the reprogramming factors to induce dedifferentiation of the cells and the creation of iPS cells. 
     Potential Commercial Uses: The invention affords a powerful new approach to creation of iPS cells without the need for viral vectors or other problematic ways of expressing the preprogramming proteins. The method can be used with any adult somatic cells, including cells from those afflicted with a disease of interest. The resulting iPS cells can be used to regenerate adult tissue of various cell types, to be used for research purposes or for development of therapeutic protocols for disease treatment

"521","Licensable Technology","Genetic Selection Method for Identifying Ligands for Transmembrane Proteins","Silver, P","Numerous transmembrane receptors have been identified as a consequence of advances in molecular, cellular and viral biology.  ?Orphan receptors? result when the corresponding ligand remains unknown.  This technology exploits the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway to provide a simple method for identifying ligands that bind transmembrane receptors that dimerize for activation.  In the presence of unfolded proteins, the transmembrane kinase IRE1p transmits a downstream signal that activates transcription of chaperone proteins and enzymes. This invention features a chimeric receptor comprised of the IRE1 kinase domain that is fused to the extracellular domain of a receptor of interest.  Upon exposure to the appropriate ligand, the chimeric receptor will oligomerize and activate the UPR signaling pathway.  By using a reporter system activated by the UPR signaling pathway, those cells where the pathway has been activated can readily be identified and selected.  

Applications/Advantages: As more DNA sequences encoding putative receptors become available, orphan receptors are becoming more numerous.  This technology can help reveal previously unknown ligands, and guide rational drug design.  One may likewise use this technology to determine peptide sequences that will fit into the ligand binding site, and potentially reveal new anti-cancer or anti-viral treatments.  As mentioned above, one can use this technology to identify a ligand or compound of interest by a simple selection based upon evaluating the reporter; one can select those cells where there has been a change in the reporter as opposed to control cells."," Drug Discovery Tools","http://www.dfci.harvard.edu/res/technology/available.asp?case_number=521&keywords=&category_id=4&category_name=Targets+and+Screens","Ruth Emyanitoff, Phone (617) 632-4010, Fax (617) 632-4012, Email Ruth_Emyanitoff@dfci.harvard.edu","Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"

Although most mutations that cause retinitis pigmentosa are in rod photoreceptor-specific genes, cone photoreceptors also die as a result of such mutations.  Retinitis pigmentosa is a family of inherited retinal degenerations (RD) that is currently untreatable and frequently leads to blindness. Affecting roughly 1 in 3,000 individuals, it is the most prevalent form of RD caused by a single disease allele (RetNet). The phenotype is characterized by an initial loss of night vision due to the malfunction and death of rod photoreceptors, followed by a progressive loss of cones.In January 2009, the Cepko lab published findings linking HDAC4 activity with survival in normal and diseased retinas (B. Chen and C. Cepko 2009 Science 323 p. 256).  Hif1? activity was shown to be necessary for HDAC4 mediated survival activity and a stabilized allele of HIF1alpha was shown to be sufficient for rod survival. HIF1alpha can transcriptionally regulate glycolytic pathways.  Similarly, changes in the insulin/mTOR pathway coincide with the activation of autophagy in cones and manipulation of the pathway via systemic administration of insulin can modulate the rate of cone death (Punzo et al. 2009 Nat. Neuro. 12(1) p. 44).  Thus, two seemingly separate observations both implicating aspects of nutrient sensing or glucose homeostasis in cones, led to a testable hypothesis.  If cones were dying because they were starving, interventions that perturb glucose homeostasis may rescue or delay cell death.The Cepko lab has created a gene therapy that could prevent the decline of vision in degenerative disease independent of etiology.  Given the recent success in treating Leber’s Congenital Amaurosis in humans with an AAV-based vector (Bainbridge et al. 2008 NEJM 358(21), Maguire et al. 2008 NEJM 358(21)) this Cepko lab invention could expand treatment options for degenerative diseases in the eye.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:A series of AAV-based gene therapy approaches to reprogram certain metabolic enzymes in rod and cone cells in the eye to promote survival in degenerative conditions such as retinitis pigmentosa. Additionally, an independent series of such vectors expressing HDAC genes and/or HIF1alpha variants to achieve the same.Given the heterogeneity of retinal degenerative disease identifying a common pathway for how degenerating cells die has led to insights into how cell death can be prevented.  The Cepko lab has been able to show with single injections in a mouse model for RP (rd1), that introducing certain genes that ultimately modulate glycolysis/gluconeogenesis in cone photoreceptor cells can prevent cell death and maintain visual function weeks after control vector-injected animals have become blind.  This concept has been validated by 2 separate gene-therapy based interventions in the same mouse model for retinitis pigmentosa.  By preventing retinal cell death, rather than addressing the molecular lesion(s) that contributed to disease, retinal degeneration can be stopped and visual function can be maintained in a generic fashion, independently of the type of disease gene.The Cepko lab is currently working to optimize vector/gene combinations and is seeking collaborators that can help drive the program into clinic development."," Therapeutics - Methods  |   Therapeutics - Drugs","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3461","Grant Zimmermann, (617) 495-3067","Harvard University"

The GRAEZing tool, developed in the lab of Dr. Richard S. Lee, MD, is a powerful way of increasing accuracy and sensitivity of MS/MS-based glycoproteomic analyses. This tool, used in conjunction with available MS instruments, allows discrimination between peptides and glycopeptides in complex mixtures of biological origin based on accurate mass measurements of precursor peaks. ||

The GRAEZ classifier may be used in conjunction with targeted MS to overcome dynamic range challenges and increase glycoproteomic coverage.  It may also be used as a QC metric for various benchtop preparations.  For example, GRAEZ may rapidly compare the effectiveness of different glycopeptide sample preparations, or evaluate the prevalence of glycosylated species in different samples. Further, GRAEZ classification of existing proteomic data sets may be used to evaluate the prevalence of glycosylated peptides in existing data, regardless of shether these species were selected for MS/MS fragmentation. This tool will improve accuracy and sensitivity of analysis of the glycoproteome in biological samples. ||

The GRAEZ classifier operates in association with multiple glycopeptide identification software and increases accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the software. The tool may also be incorporated into any high-accuracy MS acquisition engine to accurately identify glycopeptides in real time."," Bioinformatics  |   Software/Algorithms","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=2422","Khunkhun, Rajinder, rajinder.khunkhun@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"

"T001087","Licensable Technology","High Density Parallel Optical Data Storage and Retrieval","David R. Walt","Tufts University Categories:computer:data storagenanotechnology:structuresoptics:fibersAdditional Keywords:(none specified)Invention SummaryBackground:Current, conventional computer hard drives use magnetic read and write heads to store and access information from magnetic regions, called bits, on storage media.  Although the evolution of magnetic disks has progressed rapidly, physical phenomena will slow the process that has, in the past, continually increased storage density.  Summary:Prof. David Walt of the Department of Chemistry has developed a device using an array of near-field probes for high-density optical storage and retrieval.  The array employs nanometer-sized apertures to direct light and change the transmission properties of photochromic film.  In addition, each probe in the array will detect, or read, the optical changes in the film.  In this manner, the array is able to simultaneously read as many bits at a time as there are fibers in the array.  Arrays comprising up to 100,000 fibers have been prepared, but more fibers could be bundled if desired.   Coupling the imaging fiber-based near-field tip array with CCD detection allows the device to write and read a highly dense amount of information on a storage medium in a parallel fashion.  Imaging fiber bundles are easily obtained from commercial resources, and the near-field tip array is easily fabricated from these bundles.  Consequently, creating an optical read/write head using a near-field tip array is a cost-effective, high density, precisely formed component.  The device also has a minimal number of optical components, resulting in a simple setup, low cost, and ease in maintenance.  All the components of this optical storage system are common optical devices easily obtainable from commercial sources.Follow-Up:A US patent application covering this technology has been allowed and is available for licensing on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis."," Photonics/Optical Systems  |   Nanotechnology/NEMS","http://www.tufts.biz/cgi-bin/tech_search.cgi?r=1&case=T001087","Martin Son617-636-3605martin.son@tufts.edu","Tufts University"

The cryocooler 10 utilizes a recuperative heat exchanger integrally combined with a floating piston expander having a piston adapted for periodic movement within an expansion cylinder. The piston is actuatable without an external drive mechanism, but rather by selective operation of processor controlled ""smart"", variable current pulse valves which serve to alternately couple working fluid and ballast fluid to opposite ends of the cylinder. The valves are actuated in response to output signals generated by a non-invasive inductive sensor, which detects the position of the piston within the cylinder. The combination of the floating piston expander, as precisely controlled by the sensor, smart valves and a processor, with the recuperative heat exchanger, provides improved thermal efficiency relative to conventional small scale cryocoolers which typically utilize regenerative heat exchangers. The floating piston expander and recuperative heat exchanger are fabricated as an integrated, modular unit, which facilitates scaling to N modular units.

Efficient health diagnoses, drug discoveries, biomedical research, and bioscientific research depend on measuring instruments that can meet all these challenges. Drs. Abate, Crozier, Schonbrun, and Weitz developed an entirely new technology that meets all these challenges, and is relatively inexpensive to make. This new biological measuring instrument significantly exceeds the capabilities of existing instruments, such as capillary array electrophoresis, flow cytometry, and micro-array scanners.  An optical detection system, built of hundreds and thousands of confocal microscopes, is integrated with a parallel microfluidic drop maker. The combined instrument delivers large numbers of samples to discrete detection regions to improve detection throughput rates by  an order of magnitude faster than flow cytometry, currently the fastest commonly used technique. With this increase in speed and parallelism, massive data sets can be analyzed faster, more effectively, and less expensively, making this instrument a cheap tool for enhanced high throughput screening.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Dr. Crozier’s team developed a diffractive lens array (that is, the collection of confocal microscopes) that  performs massively parallel fluorescent measurements. The diffractive lens array uses   a high light collection efficiency to expand the sample area well beyond a standard microscope’s small field of view.

Devices based on fluorescent dye molecules, quantum dots and carbon nanotubes have been demonstrated, but none has combined a high single-photon flux with stable, room-temperature operation. Luminescent centers in diamond have recently emerged as a stable alternative, and, in the case of nitrogen-vacancy centers, offer spin quantum bits with optical readout. However, these luminescent centers in bulk diamond crystals have the disadvantage of low photon out-coupling. The laboratory of Marko Loncar has demonstrated a single-photon source composed of a nitrogen vacancy center in a diamond nanowire, which produces ten times greater flux than bulk diamond devices, while using ten times less power. This result enables a new class of devices for photonic and quantum information processing based on nanostructured diamond, and could have a broader impact in nanoelectromechanical systems, sensing and scanning probe microscopy.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:The novel approach taken by the Harvard researchers was to apply top-down nanofabrication techniques to define large arrays of vertically oriented nanowire antennas in a single-crystal diamond substrate. Briefly, structures were made from a commercially available Type Ib diamond crystal. Electron-beam lithography and reactive-ion etching were then used to realize 200-nm-diameter, 2-micron-long diamond nanowires with straight, smooth sidewalls. Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers are embedded randomly in fabricated devices because the diamond substrate has a background of natural NV centers that are created during the crystal growth process. A major advantage of the nanowire array platform is that the etching process itself results in mechanically isolated individual NV centers and minimized background fluorescence. The readily fabricated diamond nanowire arrays retain the crucial properties of an NV center, are compatible with the requirements needed for the realization of scalable quantum systems based on diamond, interface the nano-world of a color center with the macro-world of optical fibers and lenses, and provide a foundation for enabling the integration of NV center-embedded diamond nanostructures into more complex photonic quantum information, sensing, and imaging devices with even higher count levels and lower powers."," Instrumentation  |   Sensing/Imaging  |   Instrumentation  |   Sensing/Imaging  |   Instrumentation  |   Sensing/Imaging  |   Instrumentation  |   Sensing/Imaging","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3702","Sam Liss, (617) 495-4371","Harvard University"

The law of reflection says that a wave of particles is reflected off a boundary at an angle equal to the angle at which it hit the boundary; but is it always? Researchers at Harvard have shown for the first time that light reflected off the surface of a chiral liquid not only bounces back at a different angle, but is also split in two. Typically, one needs to detect small concentrations of chiral molecules, and so detections of deflections down to a few nanoradians is needed. The beam splitting effect could be used by analytical chemists in drug research and development to sensitively analyze the chirality of unknown substances using only a tiny sample.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:The significance of this optical effect is that it permits detection of chiral molecules in nanoliters, rather than the large sample-volumes that are currently needed in laboratory polarimeters. For the last 200 years, chiral molecules have been detected in polarimeters by observing the rotation of a plane polarized light beam that traverses an “optically active” liquid. However, this requires long path-lengths and large sample-volumes, whereas “light-splitting” occurs within a micron at an interface and can be observed in minute volumes. Using position sensitive detection (PSD) and polarization modulators we can routinely measure angular deflections of around 50 nanoradians."," Photonics/Optical Systems","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=2752","Alan Gordon, (617) 384-5000","Harvard University"
"03502","Licensable Technology","High-Sensitivity Diagnostic for Staging of Cervical Cancer","Coleman, Dulcie V.; Poznansky, Mark C.; Jaafar, Fatimah ; Leblanc, Pierre R.","Technology:
A diagnostic assay for the detection and clinical staging of cervical cancer has been developed. It uses a highly sensitive immunoassay to quantify a specific chemokine, stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1 or CXC12) and T cell regulating factors. SDF-1 levels clearly correlate with CIN or invasive cervical cancer and its level of aggressiveness. As immune control in cervical cancer is dependent on the activation and infiltration of tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTLs), which are also controlled by chemokines, the method also identifies candidates among patients for anti-chemokine or immuno-therapies.

Applications: 
- The chemokine assay may be easily integrated into existing PAP smear or endocervical biopsy screens, to identify patients at risk. 
- The assay may be automated to allow rapid readout and processing in centralized or CLIA labs, without major additional investment.
- In patients diagnosed with either CIN or the invasive form of cervical cancer, the assay can be used to stage aggressiveness and select treatments, as well as to monitor any disease recurrence post-treatment. 
-In particular, it may be used to follow the subgroup of patients who develop widspread disease,after local resection.
- The technology is applicable to other cancers where chemokine expression is upregulated ie. ovarian & pancreatic cancers, glioblastomas.

Advantages:
- The SDF1 assay provides an unambiguous method to assess disease, whereas cytodiagnosis is often ambigious. 
-The high sensitivity technique allows earlier detection and recurrence of CIN. 
- Staging of the cancer allows informed treatment selection.
- Widespread adoption due to sensitivity and ease of use, will allow the assay to be incorporated into annual gynaecological screens.

In particular, the stiffness of the underlying matrix greatly affects cell fate and behavior. For example, cultured stem cells undergo neurogenic differentiation on soft substrates (which mimic soft brain tissue), whereas on hard substrates (which mimic bone) they differentiate into bone-like cells. It is becoming increasingly clear that hydrogel substrates that mimic tissue stiffness can recapitulate key aspects of cell behavior not seen in traditional rigid tissue culture plates. Recently, a number of synthetic matrices such as PuraMatrix, AlgiMatrix and Glycosan have become commercially available. However, these products are either very costly, difficult to use, or incompatible with many cell-based high-throughput assays.

Generated libraries are also perfect candidates for printing on glass slides to form small molecule arrays (please see Harvard Case 1633 ''Small Molecule Printing'') for drug discovery efforts.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:In small molecule drug development, researchers typically develop biased libraries in which all members share a particular characteristic, such as an ability to interact with a particular target ligand or structural features designed to mimic a particular aspect of a class of natural compounds. For example, a number of libraries have been designed to mimic one or more features of natural peptides.  Although these libraries have provided reliable synthetic strategies for compounds possessing specific core functionalities, none have achieved the complexity of structure found in natural products. Complex natural products commonly contain several different functionalities and are often rich in stereochemical diversity. It is also very likely that natural products alone will not provide the hypothetical ""complete"" set of small molecules that would allow the functions of all proteins as well as their individual domains to be determined. Researchers in the lab of Professor Stuart have overcome these problems with a unique synthetic system that can recapitulate not only the diversity seen in natural products, but also mimic their biological function in vivo.      The invention is a novel, solid-support, split-pool synthetic platform that allows for high-throughput production of small molecule libraries.  The system utilizes epoxyol and isonicotinamide based templates (which are synthesized in four steps or fewer) to yield more than 2,000,000 complex and highly diverse libraries of compounds. Classes of compounds synthesized with this method can be based on the structure of existing natural products, such as a hormone, receptor, and enzymes.  Importantly, these natural product analogs retain their biological function in cell based assays.   For example, several compounds in a pool activated a TGF-b responsive reporter gene in a stably transfected mink lung cell line.  The functional groups generated from this method are displayed in a radial array, which unlike many polymers or chains of peptides, enables diversification in all directions.   This adds to the complexity of the compounds and provides them with a greater likelihood of interacting with biological molecules.  There is also a minimal need to employ protecting groups during the synthesis of the scaffold structures and combinatorial libraries."," Chemical Methods/Libraries  |   Chemical Methods/Libraries  |   Chemical Methods/Libraries","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=1487","Rene Castro, (617) 495-3663","Harvard University"

In an infected individual, subsequent antibodies (which differ from antibodies against complete gp120) can help prevent or delay further infection.  Preferably, one may use combinations of peptides corresponding to the different epitopes to elicit a series of antibodies.  Alternatively, the antibodies of the invention may be directly administered to the patient.  These antibodies may be used to deliver a desired moiety such as a cytotoxic drug or an enzyme that will specifically cleave gp120 (and thus delete the binding site).  Last, these antibodies are useful in immunoassays to detect the presence of gp120 and therefore HIV."," Research Reagents","http://www.dfci.harvard.edu/res/technology/available.asp?case_number=170&keywords=&category_id=3&category_name=Research+Reagents","Nancy Grodin, Phone (617) 632-5516, Fax (617) 632-4012, Email Nancy_Grodin@dfci.harvard.edu","Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"

Walt","Tufts University Categories:chemical:coatingschemical:polymersmaterials:polymerstherapeutic:drug deliveryAdditional Keywords:(none specified)Invention SummarySummaryProf. David Walt and colleagues at Tufts University’s Chemistry Department have developed a versatile method to uniformly fabricate hollow polymeric microspheres of controllable size, shell thickness and porosity.  Easily manufactured, these microspheres have a wide variety of promising industrial and biomedical uses, ranging from synthetic paints and adhesives to controllable drug delivery.BackgroundSeveral earlier processes for making hollow polymer microspheres exist.  One method utilizes ionization of a carboxylated core to produce hollow polymer latex particles by osmotic swelling.  Another involves an emulsion polymerization of styrene.  These earlier processes are complex and involve several steps employing different chemistries.  Moreover, they fail to achieve uniformity of sphere shape, size and shell thickness because polymerization is not restricted to the surface.  The method of the current invention, termed surface confined living radical polymerization, overcomes these limitations and provides a much simpler and more flexible method to create hollow polymeric microspheres exhibiting a variety of desired properties. AdvantagesThis method enables easy control of shell thickness and composition by adjusting polymerization time and monomer concentrations.  Shell porosity and pore size can also be controlled through a number of means including the amount of crosslinker in the polymerization mixture.  Significantly, these controllable features are highly consistent - shell thickness, for example, can be made to vary less than 0.5%.  Another aspect of the versatility of this method is exhibited by the fact that a wide range of monomers can be employed, as well as co-polymers.ApplicationsDrug Delivery Vehicle.  Control over shell thickness and porosity enables control over the rate of sustained drug release.  Microspheres may be tailored to encapsulate and release a wide range of therapeutic agents, including polypeptides, antibodies, enzymes, small molecules and nucleic acids.Paint Preparation and Production.  Organic dyes may be encapsulated to produce synthetic pigment of a desired color with improved color clarity and trueness compared to titanium dioxide solutions.  Accurate control of shell thickness furthermore results in better control of opacity and painted surface uniformity.Protecting Agent.  Microspheres may be used to stabilize materials from exposure to light, solvents or other exposures to which they may be sensitive.  Microspheres may alternatively be used as coatings, for example as sunscreen compositions or coatings on paper and photographs to protect them from light-mediated aging.Additional InformationA US patent covering this technology has issued (6,720,007) and is available for exclusive or nonexclusive licensing."," Materials  |   Chemistry  |   Chemistry","http://www.tufts.biz/cgi-bin/tech_search.cgi?r=1&case=T001130","Martin Son617-636-3605martin.son@tufts.edu","Tufts University"

Infected cells respond by initiating antiviral defenses on two levels: recruitment of specialized immune cells and establishment of a hostile cellular environment to slow virus replication and reduce viral load.  The identification of genes that control viral replication at the site of infection and viral load may provide useful therapeutic targets for treating viral infections.  Further, there remains an unmet medical need for new and effective therapeutic agents to treat viral infections.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Homozygous IKKepsilon (inhibitor of kappaB kinase epsilon) mutant mice are used as animal models for influenza virus infection. Homozygous deletion results in a complete loss of the endogenous kinase function in lung, spleen, and embryonic fibroblasts. These mice have increased susceptibility to viral infection due to defective interferon (IFN) signaling. These mice had an elevated viral load when compared to their control littermates. 7 days post infection, the lungs of the mutant mice display inflammatory infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils.

"564","Licensable Technology","HSIX1 Gene as a Diagnostic Marker for Breast Cancer","Pardee, A","The development of cancer is accompanied by a number of genetic changes; there is a pressing need to identify new marker genes (along with their expressed proteins) to selectively identify cancer in a patient.  This invention is based on the discovery that the human SIX1 gene (HSIX1) is overexpressed in tumorigenic cells.  Researchers determined the HSIX1 gene was overexpressed in samples of breast and lung tumors when compared to adjacent normal tissue samples.  Moreover, smaller scale analysis of several different tumor cell lines suggests that HSIX1 may be expressed in a wide variety of tumors in addition to breast and lung.

Applications/Advantages: As mentioned above, this technology features the HSIX1 gene, which is aberrantly expressed in primary breast cancers and metastatic lesions and in cells isolated from lung, colorectal, and cervical tumors, as well as from subjects having chronic myelogenous leukemia.  Accordingly, this invention provides methods for detecting the presence of SIX1 in a biological sample, including labeled nucleic acid and antibody probes capable of hybridizing to a SIX1 nucleic acid or binding to SIX1 protein, respectively.  One may use these probes for both diagnostic and prognostic purposes.  Further, this technology holds promise for new cancer therapies.  For example, since upregulation of SIX1 is associated with acquisition of a metastatic phenotype, decreasing expression or activity of SIX1 is expected to inhibit this metastatic progression."," Diagnostics/Biomarkers","http://www.dfci.harvard.edu/res/technology/available.asp?case_number564&keywords=&category_id=5&category_name=Diagnostics","Nancy Grodin, Phone (617) 632-5516, Fax (617) 632-4012, Email Nancy_Grodin@dfci.harvard.edu","Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"

Myocarditis presents a challenging clinical problem because it is hard to diagnose and the treatment options are limited. It has been widely thought that autoimmune myocarditis is of infectious etiology, and to date, all animal models have involved experimental induction of disease, either by infection with cardiotropic viruses or by immunization with adjuvants containing cardiac myosin. The inventors have created three lines of transgenic NOD mice that express human HLA-DQ8, resulting in the development of spontaneous myocarditis in all three lines. This was associated with premature death by heart failure, lymphocytic infiltrates in myocardial tissues, and cardiac myosin IgG autoantibodies. While the disease process was similar in all lines, its severity differed and correlated with the cell-type specific patterns of HLA-DQ8 expression. The technology features transgenic mice expressing human HLA-DQ8, which are models of autoimmune myocarditis. Like human patients, these mice develop sudden symptoms of heart failure associated with destructive lymphocytic infiltrates in the myocardium, show histology that is characteristic of myocarditis, and develop autoantibodies that recognize cardiac myosin, a major autoantigen in human myocarditis.

Intravascular imaging has provided valuable, clinically impactful insights in to CAD, coronary stent patho-physiology and pharmacotherapy responses. However, current imaging technologies only detect structure and to a lesser degree compositional analysis. Imaging technologies need to be developed to provide information on not just structure, but also biology? specific molecular and cellular changes, known to drive atherosclerosis and stent complications.  
Near Infrared Fluorescence (NIRF) imaging has emerged as a new powerful imaging modality over the last decade. When used in combination with intra-vascular ultrasound (IVUS) or optical coherence tomography (OCT) which provide structural information, NIRF can add biological information such as fibrin deposition, degree of inflammation and endothelialization and apoptosis, thereby providing molecular and biochemical information on the observed structural changes. The inventions cover devices and methods for imaging of functional or molecular activity that indicates disease within the lumen of any biological vessel or in hollow organ, using NIRF alone, or in combination with other imaging modalities.
Applications:
-Improved detection and stratification of vulnerable plaque, i.e. atherosclerotic plaques at risk of causing heart attacks and strokes, is an unmet need. 
- A catheter-based approach to detect high-risk plaques in human arteries has been developed and used to detect inflammation in atherosclerosis.
- The catheter can concomitantly use fluorescence imaging and OCT or IVUS.

Advantages:
- Increased clinical potential for in vivo detection of high-risk atherosclerotic lesions
- Evaluation of in-stent thrombosis risk, post-intervention
- Evaluation of disease progression and effects of medical treatment. 
- Useful in 3D, quantitative fluorescence imaging of hollow organs, in addition to intra-vascular imaging.
- Accurate co-registration of the fluorescence and OCT modalities due to the common optical path
- Improved fluorescence quantification using OCT and/or IVUS data
- Concurrent/ integrated capture of structure and function helps improve clinical decision-making and outcomes.

They enable performing procedures with minimal amounts of blood loss, less pain, fewer and smaller scars, and most importantly, faster recovery, with less possible complications when compared to open surgery.In most minimally invasive procedures (laparoscopy, endoscopy) several incisions of about half inch long are made. These are used to insert visual devices as well as surgical instruments. There is broad consensus that the future of minimally invasive surgery lays within single port access surgery, hence the recently growing trend, of using robots for single port operations. During operations complex manipulation tasks such as dissecting and retracting require simultaneous tip dexterity and tip stiffness. Unfortunately, surgical robots today, exhibit many problems such as high stiffness and low dexterity or high dexterity and low stiffness.The technology covered by this invention provides a device that can reduce the number of incisions into a single port of entry, provide simultaneous high tip stiffness as well increased dexterity.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:The devices and systems described herein represent significant improvements over earlier approaches.  The hybrid snake robot is comprised of a highly articulated robotic probe and a concentric tube robot. The probe is made of two separate, outer and an inner mechanisms-each composed of super elastic tubes which are conjoint via rigid tubular links. This structure enables the probe to follow a tortuous path three dimensions, making one mechanism stiff while extending the other mechanism. As a result, the system can operate a stiff sheath while the steerable cannula can enhance tip dexterity. This allows the hybrid snake system to reach tight spaces and perform delicate and complex procedures deep within tissues like the heart, lungs, brain and abdominal organs. This technology offers a number of advantages over current heart repair approaches:1. It provides both tip dexterity and stiffness that are imperative in endoscopic procedures; this cannot be achieved by the single use of any two robots. 2. The device is suitable for one port entry surgical procedures, leaving minimal scarring and reducing post operative complications rate 3. Elements of the design permit a variety of curves, which in turn enable the snake robot to operate in confined spaces, accessing anatomical targets that conventional tools cannot reach.4. Operation of the snake robot does not require a large body cavity for operating and can be deployed inside virtual spaces.This novel technology brings endoscopic surgical procedures to a new level, where challenges like reaching and operating in difficult anatomical places can be overcome by a relatively simple solution."," Medical Devices","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=4242","Michal Preminger, (617) 432-0920","Harvard University"

Endodermal cell derivatives, including lung, liver, and pancreas, are of interest for regenerative medicine, but efforts to produce these cells have been met with only modest success. As an alternative to using coculture with other cell types and growth factors as inducers, we use cell-permeable small molecules as a means to control in vitro differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Small-molecule inducers would be less expensive, more easily controlled and possibly more efficient than growth factors in directing differentiation.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:The laboratory of Douglas Melton has identified two novel cell-permeable small molecules, IDE1 and IDE2, that direct differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into the endodermal lineage. These compounds induce nearly 80% of ESCs to form definitive endoderm, a higher efficiency than that achieved by Activin A or Nodal, commonly used protein inducers of endoderm. The chemically induced endoderm expresses multiple endodermal markers, can participate in normal development when injected into developing embryos, and can continue to differentiate into pancreatic progenitors. IDE1 and IDE2 function in part via activation of TGF-beta signaling, as evident by Smad2 phosphorylation. The application of small molecules to differentiate mouse and human ESCs into endoderm represents a step toward achieving a reproducible and efficient production of desired ESC derivatives. • IDE1 or IDE2 can be used to direct differentiation of ESCs into definitive endoderm. IDE1 and IDE2 are effective on human and mouse ESC lines. • IDE1 and IDE2 are products of de novo chemical synthesis and come from a library of putative HDAC inhibitors.• Titration of IDE1 and IDE2 from 50 nM to 5 mM showed that they function in a dose-dependent manner (EC50 = 125 nM for IDE1 and EC50 = 223 nM for IDE2), with the highest efficiency and no toxicity in the 250–800 nM range.• At optimal concentration, IDE1 and IDE2 induces the expression of Sox17 (an endodermal marker) in 80% and 72% of mouse ESCs, respectively, after 6 days of treatment. More than 95% of compound-induced Sox17+ cells coexpress FoxA2, an essential gene for the development of definitive endoderm.• IDE1 and IDE2 also induce endoderm from human ESCs (HUES). Treatment with 100 nM IDE1 or 200 nM IDE2 for 4 days leads to Sox17 expression in 62% or 57% of HUES cells, respectively. More than 90% of Sox17+ cells also coexpressed FoxA2."," Research Reagents","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3605","Vivian Berlin, (617) 496-0474","Harvard University"

"662","Licensable Technology","Identification of Estrogen and Tamoxifen Regulated Genes","Polyak, K","Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death among Western women; there is a pressing need to identify risk factors for breast cancer, and to determine new molecular targets for improved therapeutic or prophylactic approaches. Estrogen is involved not only in normal development of the mammary gland, but also in breast cancer. Using bioinformatics techniques, researchers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute have identified a gene, EIT-6 (Estrogen-Induced Tag-6), which is regulated by estrogen in an estrogen dependent breast cancer cell line. Moreover, EIT-6 overexpression leads to enhanced growth of human breast cancer cells. Therefore, this technology provides a molecular target that plays a role in breast cancer cell growth.

Applications/Advantages: This technology provides the EIT-6 gene and protein, as well as a promising means for diagnosis and treatment of cancers related to aberrant EIT-6 expression. To aid diagnosis, this invention provides hybridization probes to detect EIT-6 nucleic acid, and monoclonal antibodies to identify EIT-6 proteins.

"689","Licensable Technology","Identification of HIN-1 a Putative Breast Tumor Suppressor Gene","Polyak, K","Technologies that allow early detection and treatment of breast cancer substantially improve the outcome of therapy. Breast cancer progresses through several stages; ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is the precursor of invasive breast cancer, which may spread and become life-threatening. Researchers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute have identified human gene, ""HIN-1"" (High in Normal 1), which is minimally expressed in DCIS tumors relative to normal breast tissue. Furthermore, by manipulating breast cancer cells to express HIN-1, cancer cell growth is inhibited. Collectively, these and other features make HIN-1 a candidate tumor suppressor gene.

Applications/Advantages: This technology holds promise for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The differential expression of HIN-1 between normal and cancerous breast tissue provides a marker of the disease at an early stage. Since there is evidence that HIN-1 expression is also reduced in other cancer cells (including prostate and pancreatic cancer cells), HIN-1 promises to have wide diagnostic potential. This invention provides methods for determining HIN-1 expression levels; for example, this technology includes antibodies which bind HIN-1 to determine protein concentration, and methods to determine the degree of HIN-1 promoter methylation. As outlined above, HIN-1 inhibits proliferation of breast cancer cells. This invention provides methods for increasing HIN-1 levels in diseased cells and tissues for new, potentially powerful therapeutic approaches."," Diagnostics/Biomarkers","http://www.dfci.harvard.edu/res/technology/available.asp?case_number=689&keywords=&category_id=5&category_name=Diagnostics","Nancy Grodin, Phone (617) 632-5516, Fax (617) 632-4012, Email Nancy_Grodin@dfci.harvard.edu","Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"
"3692","Licensable Technology","Identification of novel downstream effectors of the mTOR1 pathway","Blenis, John","MARKETS ADDRESSED:The mTOR pathway is a well-established drug target in cancer and immunosuppressive therapies. The discovery of new mTOR substrates may be important biomarkers as well as a novel approach for drug development: •     Novel biomarker:  Novel mTOR substrates may be used as biomarkers for the state of activation of the mTOR pathway.  In addition, they may indicate the activation status of potentially dangerous cell survival pathways via inactivation of negative feedback inhibition (mTORC1 to PI3K/Akt feedback inhibition loop).  Currently, there are no methods for predicting and monitoring this feedback mechanism.  Both protein and phosphorylation levels may be monitored in patient tissue samples to facilitate rapid design of therapeutic strategies to treat patients with altered mTORC1 activation.  •     Drug development: Cancer: Hyperactivation of mTOR signaling has been implicated in tumorigenesis. Activating mutations in the mTOR pathway may occur in as many as 35% of breast cancer cases, and is associated with a poor prognosis.  In addition, numerous anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic mTOR inhibitors are in clinical development as targeted anti-cancer therapies. Transplantation: mTOR inhibitors, such as rapamycin, are immunosuppressant drugs widely used to prevent organ rejection following transplantation. Modulators of mTOR substrates, used alone or together with already approved immunosuppressants can become a less toxic alternative to current therapies.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Background: The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a kinase that senses the availability of nutrients, energy, amino acids and growth factors to determine cell growth and proliferation. mTOR inhibitors are a class of immunosuppressants widely used to prevent rejection of organ transplants. The pathway has been found to be altered in many human cancers, and numerous mTOR inhibitors are now in clinical development as anticancer agents. Despite intense interest in developing compounds to inhibit mTOR, relatively little is known about the substrates of this kinase. Identification of novel substrates of mTOR may therefore lead to novel biomarkers for mTOR activation, and a novel approach to drug development.Novel substrates of mTOR: Using a quantitative phospho-proteomics approach, the Blenis lab discovered a series of novel substrates of mTORC1, including the growth factor receptor-bound protein 10 (Grb10).  Using a phosphor-specific antibody developed in the lab, they further show that phosphorylation of two specific serines on Grb10 was strongly inhibited by mTOR kinase inhibitors, including rapamycin.  The screen also provided additional mTOR substrates, and one of the most enriched classes of hits in the screen was the receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway.  Many reports indicate that a feedback inhibition loop exists from mTORC1 to PI3K/Akt and that patients taking mTOR inhibitors may have the secondary effect of activating other pro-survival signals.  The inventors demonstrated that Grb10 plays a pivotal role in mediating the feedback inhibition from mTORC1 to PI3K/Akt and suggest a mechanism of action for this regulation based upon their results: upon rapamycin inhibition of mTOR, the mTOR substrate accumulates, and thereby causes a hyperactive state of PI3K."," Therapeutics - Drugs","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3692","Grant Zimmermann, (617) 495-3067","Harvard University"

Dr. Schroeder et al., investigators in the Department of Anesthesia and Critical Care at Massachusetts General Hospital, have developed a novel method for calculating an image-derived input function of 18F-FDG kinetics in the lung.  This model-adjusted method to estimate a PET-derived input function allows accurate reconstruction of the time-activity curve in pulmonary arterial blood for modeling pulmonary uptake of centrally injected 18F-FDG.

Application:
This novel approach is expected to substantially facilitate studies involving compartmental modeling of 18F-FDG kinetics in the inflamed lung and may have broader applications in PET imaging of other organs and tracers.     
 
Advantages:   
-     Requires only two calibration blood samples, the first of which can be taken as late as 25 minutes after tracer injection.
-     Does not require precise knowledge of the anatomical dimensions of the blood pool ROI used.
-     Minimizes blood sampling, a process which is invasive, prone to measurement artifacts and subjects clinical staff to radiation and blood exposure.
-     Reduces the need for costly laboratory procedures.

Inventors at MGH have developed a series of PET imaging probes which can detect fibrosis and fibrogenesis. The current gold standard for identifying fibrosis is biopsy, which suffers from complications, sampling error, inter-observer variability and lack of sampling across the organ of interest. An accurate, noninvasive method of fibrosis quantification such as these imaging probes enables early diagnosis of many chronic diseases and provide a means to monitor response to therapy, thus speeding evaluation of novel treatments.  Noninvasive identification and staging of fibrosis has the potential to impact tens of millions of Americans and hundreds of millions worldwide with some form of chronic liver disease (e.g., hepatitis C), lung disease (e.g., idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), or cardiac disease (e.g., heart failure).

Application:
- Diagnosis: patients could be assessed without the need for biopsy.
- Monitoring response to treatment: is fibrosis resolving as a consequence of therapy or should another treatment be tried? 
- Monitoring disease progression: Surveillance to identify when quiescent disease becomes active in order to prioritize patients for transplants or treatment.
- Selection of patients with uniform disease profile for clinical trials of antifibrotic therapeutic.
- Monitoring disease progression in clinical trials for antifibrotic therapeutic.

Advantages:
- Non-invasive method for detecting fibrosis, monitoring disease progression, and monitoring response to antifibrotic therapies."," Diagnostic  |   Research Tool/Screening Tool  |   Diagnostic","http://www.partners.org/techtransfer/availabletechnologies/default.asp","Rebecca Listfield, rlistfield@partners.org, 617-954-9387","Massachusetts General Hospital"

Initially, the mirror is positioned relative to a first axis. The mirror is then scanned about a second axis and repositioned relative to the first axis while scanning the mirror about the second axis. This invention may be used in a weather satellite to remove prevent/reduce errors in pixel-to-pixel registration within an image frame and errors in band-to-band that occur when the various imaging bands (e.g., visual and infrared) of the MBFPA are used to image or scan selected areas of the Earth. The present invention positions the mirror relative to the first axis (e.g., elevation), and while scanning the mirror about the second axis (e.g., azimuth), the mirror is regularly repositioned in a prescribed manner relative to the first axis. That is, the invention dynamically adjusts the position of the mirror relative to the first axis while scanning about the second axis. Scanning about the first axis may be an elevation scan while scanning about the second axis may be an azimuth scan, or vis-a-versa. Advantageously, this control technique ensures that the images within each spectral band are spatially registered pixel-by-pixel within the image frame, and that the images of the various spectral bands are spatially coregistered with respect to each other. The present invention provides a scan-control technique for a single-mirror scan system that enables the use of the MBFPA in an imaging instrument."," ","http://www.ipvisioninc.com/findurl.php?uid=mitDossier:8003L","Jack Turner","Massachusetts Institute of Technology"

The  invention is an improved predictive model and a method for using that model to predict the outcome of ischemic tissue.

A limitation of prior models is that they fail to take into consideration the location-dependent vulnerability to infarction of a voxel. The location parameter may include a distance between the voxel and a core lesion, the location parameter may reflect the region in the brain the voxel is located, where different regions demonstrate different vulnerabilities to clinical deficits, or where the location parameter may indicate the collateral blood supply.

"2550","Licensable Technology","Immortalized drug-resistant cell line for propogating hES cells","Green, Howard","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Numerous research laboratories and companies throughout the world are targeting hES cells as sources of human cells for regenerative medicine to treat a variety of diseases from coronary ischemia to diabetes to spinal cord regeneration, and are utilizing hES cells to study processes of biological differentiation. This field of endeavor is exploding rapidly as the technical barriers are being overcome. Although various chemically defined media for growing hES are being evaluated, the most efficient and viable way to culture hES cells such that they remain pluripotent is utilizing feeder cells. Cells used most commonly are mouse embryo fibroblast (“MEF”) cells. Disadvantages with MEF cells, however, are that hES cells are difficult or impossible to maintain in the pluripotent state, difficult to grow, and -- since MEF cells are not immortal -- the cells tend to be variable and remain poorly characterized. Similar issues have been reported with feeder cell lines of human origin. Because of the robust and immortal nature of the MMM cell line, quality control studies that require culture reproducibility are feasible which will potentially pave the way for use in human subjects. In addition, the research market for feeders that can support pluripotent hES cells is significant.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Dr. Howard Green is world renowned for having developed the first use of cultured cells as therapeutics - keratinocytes for the regeneration of epidermis on severely burned patients. Recently, Dr. Green’s group has developed an immortalized cell line, known as MMM, which grows robustly and efficiently supports propagation of hES cells in culture.The MMM line is a unique cell line derived from fibroblasts of 12-13 day old mouse embryos.  After 24 serial subcultures, the line became established (immortalized).  It is robust and grows very rapidly (Td=16 hours).  It is very effective in supporting the growth of human embryonic stem (hES) cells.  The MMM line has been made resistant to blasticidin and zeocin, which are the most efficient drugs available for selection of hES cells transfected with exogenous genes.MMM cells were found to be superior to the commonly used MEFs for the maintenance of stem cell character of the hES line H9 when cocultivated (Iuchi et al., Differentiation, 74: 160, 2006).  In addition, the hES line known as H1, which is very difficult to grow on MEFs, has been demonstrated to be serially cultivatable on MMM cells. The H1 cells are able to grow very well, and retain the stem cell property of pluripotentiality, as shown by the retention of nuclear Oct4 (Photo 1).  The well-circumscribed borders of these colonies can also be seen by Differential Interference Contrast Microscopy (Photo 2).The significant advantages of MMM cells for support of hES cells include –•     Indefinite lifespan (immortalized); •     Rapid growth rate;•     Better support of hES cells than MEFs;•     Excellent ability to support growth of difficult-to-grow hES lines, with maintenance of the pluripotential state;•     Their resistance to blasticidin and zeocin makes it possible to select, by drug treatment, for hES cells into which exogenous genes have been introduced, without killing the supporting MMM"," Tissue Engineering","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=2550","Grant Zimmermann, (617) 495-3067","Harvard University"

A variety of strategies are under investigation for the introduction into diabetic patients of functioning pancreatic islet cells, which can produce insulin and overcome the diabetic phenotype. Although some results have been encouraging, islet transplantation has only recently begun to be explored in human clinical trials. Problems encountered to date relate to the insufficient supply of human islet cells from cadavers, and the need for recipients to take immunosuppressant drugs for their entire lifetime, with the resulting problems of toxicity and side effects such as elevated cholesterol and risk of heart disease. Other avenues involving human stem cells, while intriguing, may be hindered by recent government policies restricting some forms of stem cell research. The present invention potentially overcomes these hurdles through the discovery that a certain adult cell type evades immune mediated attack, and can be used to deliver polypeptides such as insulin to a human patient without fear of autoimmune rejection. The invention comprises an improved method for treatment of diabetes using cell transplantation. Intermediate lobe pituitary cells can be genetically engineered to express insulin or other proteins in sufficient quantities to overcome the diabetic phenotype in animal models, and can then be implanted into the patient, to deliver these proteins without fear of autoimmune rejection. The use of these cells to express other therapeutically useful proteins is being investigated, and in general, the cells have several potential advantages over neuroendocrine cell types, including increased viability and better expression of insulin."," Therapeutics - Methods","http://www.joslinresearch.org/inventions","David J.

"MCL 3483.0","Licensable Technology","Implantable Electroconvulsive Therapy","Oscar Morales, M.D.","Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a treatment for psychiatric disorders such as depression or other neuropsychiatric disorders in which seizures are induced with electricity for therapeutic effect. In existing methods of ECT, electrodes are placed on either side of the patient's head and electrical stimuli are delivered to the patient's brain through the electrodes. Electrical stimuli are thus broadly applied throughout the brain, and the induced transcranial seizures can span large portions and different areas of the brain. ECT treatment can lead to several known side effects including confusion and memory loss. The present invention, intracranial electrical seizure therapy (ICEST), avoids such side effects by using an electrode implanted in the patient's brain to deliver electrical stimulation to a more limited, focused target site. Such treatment induces a seizure that starts at the target site and spreads throughout a localized or generalized volume of the brain. The focal application of the electrical stimulation reduces the exposure of non-targeted brain areas to the applied stimulation, which in turn reduces side effects resulting from the electrical stimulation of these non-targeted areas.
     Potential Commercial Uses: The seizures induced by ICEST will trigger physiological effects, such as regulation of neuron cell growth factors, axonal sprouting and neurogenesis, that will enable intervention for neuropsychiatric conditions characterized by neuron cell loss or degeneration. ICEST treatment is expected to be useful for disorders such as depressive disorder, bipolar affective disorder, schizoaffective disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and possibly also neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease, while leading to fewer side effects than traditional ECT therapy.

"02353","Licensable Technology","Implanted Polymer Device for Ischemic Mitral Regurgitation","Hung, Judy W; Vlahakes, Gus J.; Levine, Robert Aaron; Guerrero, Jose Luis","Technology:
Ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) is a complication of coronary artery disease that promotes heart failure and doubles mortality in patients with heart disease. It develops in roughly 400,000 new patients per year, half following MI and half with new heart failure. IMR results from left ventricular (LV) distortion, which displaces the papillary muscles to which the mitral leaflets are attached, and tethers the leaflets into the ventricle, restricting their closure. 
Therapy for IMR remains problematic. Mitral annular ring reduction, often applied during bypass surgery, increases surgical mortality but does not address the broader problem of ischemic LV distortion. Its benefits are incomplete, particularly as the LV continues to postoperatively dilate.

The inventors have devised a method for controlled localized remodeling of the ventricle to treat IMR. This is achieved by image-guided delivery of a hydrogel polymer into damaged areas of the myocardium. Acute and chronic studies done in sheep show the feasibility of this treatment.

Applications: 
-Ischemic Mitral Regurgitation (IMR) 
-Heart Failure: Reversing ventricular dilatation and correcting valvular dysfunction

Advantages:
-A minimally invasive, lower risk technique, could be performed without open-heart surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass, which makes it available for the seriously ill patient population
-Overcomes risks of surgical repair techniques
-The polymer hydrogel injected into the myocardium causes reverse remodeling and reduces acute IMR 
- The gel is non-bioresorbable and maintains its shape.

The technology is a new implantable device and novel methods for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgeries using bone-patellar tendon-bone graft. Current double-tunnel ACL reconstruction surgeries are technically challenging and are often time consuming and costly.  The novel technique can anatomically reconstruct the ACL and potentially restore normal joints function and minimize complications during surgery, which helps to accelerate healing time for the patients.

Amidation reactions are therefore a crucial synthetic tool.  However, current processes for introducing the amide group, such as reactions of carboxylic acid derivatives, modified Staudinger reactions, halide aminocarbonylation, ketoxime and aldoxime rearrangements, and transition-metal-catalyzed aminocarbonylation of alkenes and alkynes, are often procedurally complex, frequently involve costly or hazardous reagents, and may produce toxic chemical waste.   Additionally, they usually require harsh reaction conditions such as high temperatures and high pressure.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:The Madix and Friend laboratories have developed a novel amide synthesis that uses metallic silver or silver-based alloy with oxygen adsorbed on the surface to catalyze the reaction of primary or secondary amines with alcohols or aldehydes. The catalyst may be supported on another solid and may be promoted with additives if desired; it can also be used in the pure, unsupported state. One of the main advantages of this synthesis is that the starting materials are not only inexpensive and widely-available, but they are also safe to handle and produce environmentally friendly byproducts (under optimal conditions, only water).  Furthermore, this reaction provides for heterogeneous catalysis, and takes place under mild reaction conditions (at or near room temperature and atmospheric pressure).

DW-MRI is sensitive to the incoherent motion (IM) of water molecules inside an area of interest. Motion of water molecules is known to be a combination of a slow diffusion component associated with the Brownian motion of water molecules, and a fast diffusion component associated with the bulk motion of intravascular molecules, for example, in the micro-capillaries of tissue vasculature. These phenomena may be characterized via a model referred to herein as the intra-voxel incoherent motion (IVIM) model having a slow diffusion decay parameter, a fast diffusion decay parameter and a fractional contribution of the above two motion components of the DW-MRI signal decay. ||

The technique has been used to image biomarkers in various clinical applications.  However, conventional implementations of the IVIM model have substantial drawbacks due to the difficulty in determining reliable estimates of the IVIM model parameters from the DW-MRI signal/data, and suffers from a key limitation in that only part of the information from the magnetic signal is modeled.  In particular, reliable estimates of IVIM model parameters are difficult to obtain for a number of factors including the non-linearity of the DW-MRI signal decay; the limited number of DW-MRI images as compared to the number of the IVIM model parameters and the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) observed in DW-MRI signals obtained from the body. Therefore, conventional techniques frequently lead to imprecise parameter estimates, which have hampered the practical usage of DW-MRI.  ||

Simon Warfield, PhD, director of the Computational Radiology Laboratory, and his group at Boston Children’s have developed a new model of DW-MRI, known as IM-FBM (incoherent motion fusion bootstrap moves) that addresses the key limitation.  This technique models the entire magnetic signal, thus increasing the reliability of the information without the acquisition of more data.  The inventors have developed an IM model and techniques for estimating the model parameters that accounts for both intra-voxel and inter-voxel interactions. Additionally, the inventors have developed techniques that facilitate improving the accuracy and precision of estimating model parameters for the IM model.    ||

IM-FBM was used to analyze MRI data from 30 abdominal patients and 3 patients with musculoskeletal lesions.  When compared to IVIM, IM-FBM increased the contrast-to-noise ratio significantly."," Diagnostics/Prognostics  |   Bioinformatics","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=2602","Yen, Alan, alan.yen@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"

Models that seek to represent the contribution from multiple fascicles have been reported to be numerically challenging and unstable.  Another drawback of current techniques is that they do not consider each fascicle independently.

Simon Warfield, PhD, director of the Computational Radiology Laboratory, and his group at Boston Children’s have developed a novel diffusion MRI acquisition scheme that can better characterize each white matter fascicle.  More specifically, the model enables the determination of the orientation of the white matter fascicles, measures of their local diffusion properties, and the characterization of an unrestricted water component that is important in assessing edema and inflammation. The technique, called CUSP, combines cubical and spherical q-space sampling and when paired with a novel estimation algorithm, it enables rapid and effective investigation of white matter fascicles in both normal development and in disease and injury. ||

They have created an algorithm to computationally unmix/deconvolve overlapping isotope patterns of the differentially labeled peptide species. Specifically, this novel strategy allows researchers to increase the multiplexity of the well-established SILAC (Stable Isotope Labeling by Amino acids in Cell culture) strategy from a 2- or 3-plex to a 5-plex version using commercially available stable isotope labeled L-arginine and L-lysine isotopologues. Using these amino acids results in overlapping isotope peaks, which can be unmixed using our novel algorithm. ||

These materials enable the continued progression of Moore's Law, allowing ever-smaller components to be integrated onto a microelectronic chip.  In current device fabrication facilities, vapor deposition is a preferred method for making these materials, allowing precise control over material uniformity and stoichiometry.  Successful precursors for vapor deposition must be volatile, thermally stable, and highly reactive.  Identifying compounds that meet all of these challenging requirements is difficult.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:A new class of metal complex precursors has been identified for use in atomic layer deposition (ALD) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD), using bicycle guanidines as ligands as opposed to acetamidines.  The ALD process involves the alternating delivery of two or more vapors to a surface on which reactions take place to deposit a solid product.  While slower than CVD deposition, ALD allows for the uniform deposition of extremely thin layers in very tight geometries such as those found in modern DRAMs.  When compared to traditional precursors such as halides, alkoxides, dialkylamides, and organometallics, this new class of metal complex precursors has greatly improved volatility, thermally stability, and high reactivity.

Current carbocyanine fluorophores are often limited by difficult synthesis procedures, lack of compatibility with bioorthogonal conjugation schemes and structural features that limit fluorescence quantum yields, extinction coefficients, and/or stability.  The inventors have developed a novel strategy for the synthesis of improved monofunctional far-red/near-infrared (NIR) cyanine dyes.  These novel compositions and methods provide for the modification of malonaldehyde dianil dye precursors to prepare a new class of monofunctional far-red/NIR pentamethine carbocyanine dye derivatives.  These novel compositions (dyes) are extremely bright (extinction coefficients greater than 215,000 M-1 cm-1 and quantum yields 0.17 or higher) and demonstrate significantly improved photostability (28% less photobleaching when compared to Cy5 after an hour of irradiation).  Further, these dyes permit the direct installation of a variety of functional groups, such as carboxyl, azido and alkynyl groups.

Application:
These dyes can be conjugated to peptides, proteins, polymers, etc. for use as probes in biological and/or in vivo imaging applications.  Also, these dyes can be used in fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry applications through bioconjugation to the cell or biomolecule of interest.  Further, these dyes may be useful as components in devices (for medical or other applications) that utilize fiber optics via attachment of the dyes to the surfaces of optical fiber bundles.

Advantages:
-  Novel synthetic process produces yields of up to 65%, compared to standard synthesis yields of often only <10%.  
-  Minimization of dye side products during synthesis; purity of end-products is =95%.
-  Strong NIR fluorescence emission, high extinction coefficients and good quantum yields.
-  Direct installation of diverse functional groups to the dye during the condensation reaction eliminates the time and expense of additional reactions that can diminish the dye's quantum yield and extinction coefficient.

"3631","Licensable Technology","Improved performance of copper interconnects","Gordon, Roy G.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:This invention, together with the invention from Harvard Case 3181, provides a more effective barrier around Cu interconnects which results in a longer living and faster functioning Integrated Circuits (ICs or chips) with lower power usage. Using commercially available precursor chemicals and deposition equipment, these methods can be readily adopted in standard CMOS manufacturing fabs.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Copper (Cu) is now the preferred material for interconnections in ICs because it conducts better and lasts longer than aluminum.   However, there are well-known problems with copper interconnects.  Copper tends to migrate out of the wiring, degrading the operation of the IC.  It can be corroded by exposure to oxygen and water.  The phenomenon of electromigration can thin the copper interconnects, increasing their resistance and eventually breaking them, which lessens the useful life of the IC.  Currently-used, tantalum-based barriers occupy volume of the wiring that should be filled with more conductive Cu, resulting in higher power consumption and slower operation of the IC. All these effects need to be countered to improve the performance of copper interconnects.The invention, coupled with the invention in Harvard Case 3181, surround the copper with a superior protective barrier and stabilizing layer that solves the above-mentioned problems with Cu interconnects.Case 3181 (see published PCT/US2009/37826, WO2009/117670) involves a new method of first depositing a conformal thin film of Mn (or Co, Cr or V) into the insulator walls of vias and trenches to form a self-aligned barrier of MnSixOy. Then standard technology is used to fill them with Cu.  Finally, a similar metal film is deposited on top of a Cu-filled trench after a CMP step as a capping layer to adhere the Cu strongly to the next layer of Si3N4.  Use of these barriers and adhesion layers should increase the speed and lifetime of ICs, while decreasing their power consumption. Case 3631 ( US provisional filed October 2009) improves on the capping layer of case 3181 by adding a step before metal deposition that allows the metal deposition on Cu while preventing a metal layer from forming on the insulator.  This process preserves the necessary properties of the insulator – a very desirable result.  The new step involves reacting the surface after a CMP step with silane vapors.  The silanes protect the insulator, but not the Cu, from deposition of the barrier and adhesion metal."," Materials  |   Microelectronics/MEMS  |   Electrical Engineering  |   Semiconductors","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3631","Mick Sawka, (617) 496-3830","Harvard University"

The technique can reveal tissue architecture in both normal and disease states. DTI has become the standard technique for imaging white matter disorders.  ||

Simon Warfield, PhD, director of the Computational Radiology Laboratory, and his group at Boston Children’s have developed a novel biophysical model that addresses some of the fundamental limitations of DTI.  The technique, known as DIstribution of Anisotropic MicrO-structural eNvironments with Difusion-weighted imaging (DIAMOND), utilizes a generalized statistical distribution model to provide higher resolution of tissue microstructures.  In addition, DIAMOND uses a novel acquisition scheme that provides a two-fold reduction in imaging time when compared to state of the art techniques.  ||

The DIAMOND technique was used to image the brain of a patient with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), a genetic disorder characterized by the presence of benign tumors in the brain called cortical tubers.  The results showed that the estimated fascicle orientations successfully matched the known anatomy.

However, a major challenge in the path towards clinical translation is the ability to efficiently repair clinically relevant gene mutations and prevent off-target mutagenesis. CRISPR/Cas9 system is a genome-editing tool for site-directed genome editing in mammalian cells. Gene editing by CRISPR/Cas9 utilizes double-strand brakes generated by Cas9, followed by non-homologous end joining repair. Problem is it that may result in small-unintended insertions and deletions, disrupting coding of the targeted gene.||

Dr. Rossi and his team found that is possible to improve the gene repair efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9 system through transient expression of Rad 52 and a dominant negative isoform of 53BP1 involved in DNA repair pathways. In studies, his lab found a 3-5-fold increase in repair efficiency at targeted loci at multiple loci in primary cells as well as tissue-specific adult stem cells.

SRF is a highly conserved transcription factor that binds the CArG box, and it is known that knockouts of SRF are lethal. Genes whose transcription is activated by SRF were found to have elevated expression in human subject with insulin resistance compared to controls. The inventors further showed that inhibition of SRF transcriptional activity with a small molecule inhibitor led to enhanced Akt phosporylation in vitro, and to increased insulin sensitivity in animal models. The invention therefore provides a potentially promising new target for the treatment of diabetes or insulin resistance. Inhibition of SRF transcriptional activity, using available small molecule inhibitors or others, can lead to improved glycemic control, thus affording a potentially powerful approach to the treatment of diabetes or insulin resistance."," Therapeutics - Methods","http://www.joslinresearch.org/inventions","David J.

The brain includes gray matter connected by channels of white matter, composed of the fiber bundles, and the diffusion of water along these white matter tracks allows them to be identified by DT-MRI. Such brain tractography enables construction of normative maps of fully functional brains and the detection of circuitry differences between functional and dysfunctional brains. To reduce the likelihood that anomalies in a single subject skew the results, DT-MRI is beginning to involve larger numbers of subjects. Although data are often averaged across all subjects, insufficient treatment of subject-to-subject variations causes an unnecessarily high level of apparent subject-to-subject incoherence at the voxel level.
     Potential Commercial Uses: The invention comprises a system and a method (i.e., an algorithm) for processing DT-MRI data to greatly reduce the effects of unmeasured and unspecified variations when estimating aggregate diffusion tensor directions over multiple subjects. The method is expected to lead to substantial improvements in the performance of DT-MRI, making it a much more useful technique for both research and clinical uses. Improved ability to identify and define brain circuitry patterns in both healthy and ill individuals will yield a better understanding of the factors that contribute to anomalous development and thus may lead to more effective preventative measures and treatments.

Approximately 5,600 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with ALS each year. The incidence of ALS is two per 100,000 people, and it is estimated that as many as 30,000 Americans may have the disease at any given time. 80% of patients die within five years following diagnosis, where normally death is due to respiratory failure. To this day, there is no effective treatment for the ALS; the only drug currently approved by the FDA is a NMDA receptor antagonist (riluzole) that increases the rate of survival by 6 months. It is imperative to find new drugs for this disease and try to better understand the causes and mechanism of action, which are still largely unknown.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:It has been impossible to isolate viable human motor neurons from patients or from postmortem samples to investigate the mechanisms leading to neural degeneration in ALS. A potential solution is to use embryonic stem cells (ESC) as a renewable source of cells carrying the disease genes for the study of disease processes. The Eggan laboratory of Harvard University has successfully developed in vitro models of ALS by differentiating mouse and human ESCs into motor neurons (Di Giorgio et al, 2007; Di Giorgio et al, 2008). These cells show pathogenic properties similar to those observed in ALS patients and in transgenic animals. Both systems will provide an inexhaustible supply of ALS-affected motor neurons for research. Also, they can be developed into high-throughput cell-based assays to screen for small molecules that promote survival of mutant SOD1 motor neurons in motor neuron diseases, such as ALS and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).Using the human ESC-based ALS model, the Eggan’s group has discovered that inhibition of signaling through the classic prostaglandin D2 receptor DP1 suppresses the toxic effect of SOD1 glia on motor neurons, hence providing a target for developing new methods of treatment for ALS."," Research Tools  |   Therapeutics - Methods  |   Research Tools  |   Therapeutics - Methods  |   Research Tools","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=2964","Vivian Berlin, (617) 496-0474","Harvard University"

"3588","Licensable Technology","Increasing neural regeneration following traumatic injury: Modulation of neuronal outgrowth with HSPG (heparin) and CSPG (chondroitin)","Flanagan, John G.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Research in the Flanagan laboratory provides new therapeutic approaches to enhance neural regeneration, and sheds new light on the functions of the RPTP family.  Therapeutic applications include spinal cord injury, as well as other forms of neural injury and neurodegeneration that involve reactive astrogliosis such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, peripheral nerve injury, skin burn and eye injury affecting optic nerve fibers.  Specifically, this technology covers novel therapeutic approaches to induce axonal outgrowth of a neuron, including agents which:•     Inhibit interaction between RPTPsigma and CSPGs: Develop a therapeutic agent to enhance neural regeneration by inhibiting the interaction between CSPGs and RPTPsigma.  The identification of the specific binding site on RPTPsigma that interacts with CSPGs provides a lead for drug design.  •     Induce clustering of RPTPsigma with HSPGs and heparin oligosaccharides: Develop a therapeutic agent to enhance neuronal outgrowth by inducing the clustering of RPTPsigma.  Agents that promote clustering of RPTPsigma include HSPGs and heparin oligosaccharides.In addition, the lab discovered that RPTPsigma can be used as a novel injury biomarker. RPTPsigma was shown to selectively recognize injured versus uninjured adult CNS tissue.  Therefore, administration of a tagged form of RPTPsigma can be used to anatomically localize the site of neural injury.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Researchers in the Flanagan lab uncovered a novel therapeutic approach to increase neural regeneration following traumatic injury such as spinal cord injury.  Type II receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) are cell surface receptors important for the development, function and repair of the nervous system.  They localize to axonal growth cones where they promote outgrowth, mediate axon guidance and participate in excitatory synapse formation and maintenance.  The Flanagan lab discovered that one member of the RPTP family, RPTPsigma, binds both chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CPSGs) and heparin sulphate proteoglycans (HSPGs), which are known to play important roles in neuronal guidance and connectivity.  The lab further demonstrated that these proteoglycans mediate opposing effects on neuronal outgrowth, with CSPGs inhibiting and HSPGs promoting axon growth, and uncovered the molecular mechanisms of these interactions.CSPGs inhibit neuronal outgrowth: The injured adult central nervous system inhibits axon outgrowth, thereby limiting recovery from traumatic injury.  Following neural injury, CSPG is dramatically upregulated within the extracellular matrix of scar tissue, resulting in inhibition of nerve regeneration.  The Flanagan lab discovered the first identified receptor for a CSPG, RPTPsigma (Shen et al. Science 2009; 326:592-6).  The lab demonstrated that CSPG3, a major CSPG produced by reactive astroglia following spinal cord injury, binds to RPTPsigma.  The lab further identified the binding site for this interaction and demonstrated that RPTPsigma is functionally involved in the inhibitory effects of CSPG on neural regeneration.  HSPGs promote neuronal outgrowth: In contrast to CSPGs, HSPGs strongly promoted outgrowth of wild type neurons. This effect was completely abolished in RPTPsigma deficient neurons.  To understand the observed dichotomy in CSPG/HSPG function mediated through a common receptor, the lab generated a series of deletion constructs of the type II RPTPs. Their research showed that heparin sulphate (HS) induced clustering of RPTPsigma, while chondroitin sulphate (CS) did not induce clustering of any of the type II RPTPs.  These contrasting effects were mediated by differences in chemical structure between HS and CS.  Using a competitive binding assay, the lab further showed that excess CS could inhibit HS-induced clustering.  Molecular switch: Findings from their research suggest that HS-stabilized RPTPsigma clusters are growth promoting.  In contrast, at the scar tissue, the abundantly secreted CS molecules likely out-compete the HS interactions, disrupting the clusters to establish a more even distribution of RPTPsigma across the cell surface.  This breakdown of microdomain structure could serve as a molecular switch to trigger the collapse of neuronal growth cones."," ","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3588","Grant Zimmermann, (617) 495-3067","Harvard University"

Approximately 5,600 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with ALS each year. The incidence of ALS is two per 100,000 people, and it is estimated that as many as 30,000 Americans may have the disease at any given time. Studies aimed at understanding the root causes of motor neuron death in ALS and efforts to develop new therapeutics would be greatly advanced if a robust supply of human motor neurons carrying the genes responsible for this condition could be generated. In addition, a long sought goal of regenerative and transplantation medicine has been to use cells or tissues genetically matched to a patient.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Kevin Eggan’s group of Harvard University has successfully generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) directly from patients. A number of iPS cell lines were generated using fibroblasts taken directly from patients suffering from familial or sporadic forms of ALS. These iPS cells are truly pluripotent stem cell lines with a gene expression signature similar to human embryonic stem cells and are capable of differentiating into cell types derived from the three embryonic germ layers. These cells are immortal and can be grown in the laboratory indefinitely, and can also generate any of the body’s specialized cell types.  Most importantly, these iPS cells can be robustly differentiated into motor neurons, the cell type destroyed in ALS. The patient-specific iPS cells produced from familial ALS patients will be important tools for further studies of mechanisms by which familial disease arises. Also, since more than 90% of ALS patients are afflicted by a sporadic form of disease, patient-specific iPS cells generated from individuals with sporadic disease would carry the precise constellation of genetic information associated with pathology in that person. This approach would allow study of living motor neurons generated from ALS cases with unknown genetic lesions, providing insight into their intrinsic survival properties, their interactions with other cell types, and their susceptibility to the environmental conditions that are considered to play an important role in ALS pathogenesis."," Drug Discovery Tools  |   Research Reagents","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3205","Vivian Berlin, (617) 496-0474","Harvard University"

In all embodiments, this animal model is a result of reduced activity of scavenger receptor class BI (SR-BI) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). In a preferred embodiment, the model is a result of crossbreeding two transgenic mouse lines: a knockout of SR-BI (SR-BI-/-) and an impaired ApoE expressor (hypoE). The impaired ApoE gene results in only 2-5% expression of ApoE and a reduction in cholesterol homeostasis. Resulting animals are predisposed to hypercholesterolemia but can live longer than a year on a normal low fat diet. Serum plasma levels can be significantly elevated by changing the animal's diet to one containing high levels of fat and cholesterol. Within a month on a high fat, high cholesterol diet, animals develop atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction occurs. Survival depends on the nature of the diet and the conditions of animal husbandry and can typically be around 20-30 days after administration of the modified diet depending on the specific conditions. Housing the animals alone or in groups significantly affects survival of these animals on a high fat diet. Analysis of B- and T-cell deficient SR-BI/ApoE/RAG2 triple knockout mice established that B- and T-lymphocytes do not play a key role in the pathophysiology of the SR-BI ApoE dKO model of human disease.

By varying degree to which the link coil is inductively coupled to the heating coil or by changing the capacitance, either using a variable capacitor or switching among different capacitors, changes in the amount of reactance coupled into the heating coil are effected. Thus, the current in the corresponding heating coil can be varied, enabling adjustment of the heating of the workpiece. Accordingly, the resulting system is efficient since only a single coil rather than multiple series coils are used. This aspect can be enhanced when litz cable is used in coil construction. Further, the system is compatible with active control."," ","http://www.ipvisioninc.com/findurl.php?uid=mitDossier:6758L","Ben Palleiko","Massachusetts Institute of Technology"

"CCMC   2299","Licensable Technology","Influenza Virus Vaccine Strategy","Harrison, Stephen","Seasonal antigenic drift in the influenza virus accounts for the absence of long-term immune protection in previously infected individuals. The hemagglutinin (HA), a trimeric surface glycoprotein that binds the viral receptor and promotes fusion and penetration from low-pH endosomes, is the principal surface antigen on influenza virions. HA presents conserved as well as variable epitopes, but neutralizing antibodies against the latter dominate the response to immunization and infection. ||

Dr. Harrison's laboratory has discovered novel antibodies having principal contacts in the receptor pocket. They derive from a B-cell lineage, found by isolating rearranged heavy- and light-chain genes from sorted single plasma cells, obtained from a subject who had received the 2007 trivalent vaccine.  Two antibodies in this lineage, CH65 and CH67, neutralize a remarkably broad range of H1 seasonal isolates spanning more than three decades. There is also tentative evidence for reactivity with an H5 isolate.  The 14-residue heavy-chain complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR-H3) inserts into the receptor pocket, mimicking many of the interactions made by sialic acid. Both heavy- and light-chain CDRs participate in more restricted, additional contacts with the outward-facing surface of HA1. The human B-cell repertoire thus includes the potential to generate antibodies directed primarily at the receptor-binding site. The large number of seasonal H1 viruses neutralized by antibodies CH65 and CH67 suggests that such responses are ordinarily too rare to select for resistance, or that resistance comes at too great a fitness cost - as would be the case if potential escape mutations were to compromise receptor binding. Thus, the inventors have discovered that broad neutralization of influenza virus can be achieved by antibodies with contacts that mimic those of the receptor, and their invention provides novel antibodies that indeed exhibit such mimicry. These novel antibodies might effectively treat and/or prevent infection by drifted strains of influenza. ||

Target expression is significantly decreased in prostate tumor samples.  Data suggests the loss of target expression in prostate cancer promotes fatty acid uptake into mitochondria to meet a biogenergetic requirements of these cells.  Overexpression of the target reverses this metabolic phenotype.  Activators of the target may present a unique strategy for treating cancers with enhanced FA catabolism as a metabolic profile.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:The processes of fat oxidation and fat synthesis are largely regulated by acetyl-coA carboxylase (ACC).  ACC converts acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, which serves as a substrate for fatty acid synthesis and as an inhibitor of long-chain fatty acid oxidation.  In this case, ACC activation increases the production of fatty acids, while ACC inhibition reduces fatty acid production.For logical reasons, ACC inhibition has been identified as a pathway of interest in metabolic disease treatment.  Errors in fatty acid metabolism have implicated in the development of obesity, diabetes, and fatty liver diseases. On the other hand, reduced ACC activity may play a role in the development of certain cancers that exhibit slow glycolosis and a greater dependence on fatty acid catabolism, such as some prostate cancers.    Here we report the role of particular target in fatty acid metabolism, wherein the target activates an ACC isoform, consequently inhibiting long chain fatty acid oxidation.Dr. Haigis’ laboratory has shown that the target interacts with ACC, leading to decreased fatty acid oxidation.  The target may act as a sensor of oxygen, ROS, and a-ketogluterate levels in cells and as a potential metabolic switch in some cancers."," Therapeutics - Drugs","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=4768","Michal Preminger, (617) 432-0920","Harvard University"

This technology provides methods and compositions for modulating apoptosis, and is based upon the recent discovery of a novel interaction between Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel-2 (VDAC2) and BAK, a pro-apoptotic molecule.  In viable cells, VDAC2 interacts with an inactive monomeric conformation of BAK.  A member of the pro-apoptotic ?BH3-only? molecules displaces VDAC2 from BAK, enabling homo-oligomerization of BAK and subsequent apoptosis.  One may use this technology to encourage or inhibit apoptosis by disrupting or promoting the VDAC2/BAK complex, respectively.

By modifying the casting solution used to manufacture polymer membranes with a  simple, low-cost dopants such as salt and clay, permeability can be increased by 100 – 400%, with a dramatic improvement in anti-fouling performance."," ","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=4345","Sam Liss, (617) 495-4371","Harvard University"

"3189","Licensable Technology","Instrument for massively parallel single molecule binding  measurements","Wong, Wesley Philip","MARKETS ADDRESSED:The ability to quantify interactions between biomolecules is of great interest for scientific and medical research, as well as for drug development. Currently, measurements of the affinity and the kinetics of biomolecular interactions are typically performed in solution, using methods such as calorimetry, stop-flow imaging, or surface plasmon resonance. However, these bulk measurements are limited in many ways, including 1) they report only average behavior, often losing important details associated with metastable states and rare events, and 2) they measure chemistry in the absence of externally applied mechanical stress, which can be dramatically different from the crowded and dynamic environments of living systems. The relatively new field of single-molecule manipulation addresses these problems by directly measuring the behavior of single molecular interactions under force. This enables the study of the mechanical properties of biomolecular complexes and cellular targets, yielding valuable information into both the structure and the function of biological systems at the nanoscale. The field has been largely driven by technology such as the atomic force microscope and optical tweezers. However, these technologies are very expensive and characterization of a single biological interaction is slow and painstaking. Harvard’s high-throughput single-molecule measurement device addresses many of the problems of previous single-molecule methods, while retaining single-molecule sensitivity and control. The instrument can be used for quantifying the affinity and force dependent kinetics of a pair of molecules, as well as exploring the internal states of a single molecule by stretching and relaxing it under force. The single molecule probe finds applications in drug discovery and development, and life science research.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Harvard researchers have developed a radical new method for making massively-parallel, high-throughput single-molecule force measurements. This approach brings single-molecule experimentation to the common scientist by overcoming the laborious measurements, high cost and technical skill that other techniques require. The new instrument is a spinning microscope in which the resulting centrifugal force acts simultaneously on a multitude of single molecules (e.g. proteins, DNA) or single molecular complexes (e.g. receptor-ligand pairs). Each single-molecule system can be observed directly and independently for true single-molecule detection. Another advantage of this technology is that it can provide accurate, calibration-free force control in a wide range of directions and magnitudes, enabling the convenient quantification of a wide variety of force-dependent interactions. This invention provides dramatic advantages in cost, versatility, and especially efficiency, reducing experimental time from days to minutes.Above is a diagram.  A rotary stage spins a miniaturized microscope, imparting a centrifugal force on beads interacting with a cover slip (inset, right). Transmitted light microscope images are sufficient to clearly distinguish between stuck, tethered, and untethered beads (inset, left). Dynamic readout and control of the CCD, LED, and piezo translator during rotation is enabled by an integrated fiber optic rotary joint with electricalslip ring or wireless transmission device (not shown)."," Drug Discovery Tools  |   Instrumentation","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3189","Alan Gordon, (617) 384-5000","Harvard University"

Although the existence of the third glucose responsive transcription factor has been implicated, the inventor is the first to clone the gene encoding this factor. There are several potential applications of this discovery to diabetes and other insulin-related disorders. The invention includes methods of therapy for diabetes or other insulin-related disorders, using the transcription factor to modulate the expression of the insulin gene, and hence modulate production of insulin in the body. This could be done by gene therapy to deliver the gene for the transcription factor and/or to modulate its activity or expression. Other therapeutic approaches involving cell therapies are also possible. In addition, the molecular interaction of the transcription factor with its DNA binding element can be used as a target for drug discovery, to identify drugs that disrupt or enhance the ability of the factor to bind the enhancer. A third embodiment relates to the fact that genetic defects in the two other known insulin transcription factors correlate to a susceptibility to develop diabetes, so that the invention may lead to a useful diagnostic assay if this new factor also correlates to such a susceptibility."," Drug Discovery Tools  |   Therapeutics - Methods","http://www.joslinresearch.org/inventions","David J.

E. faecalis can cause life-threatening infections in humans, especially in the hospital environment. E. faecalis is resistant to many commonly used antimicrobial agents, including Vancomycin. Phage therapies have been used as an alternative to antibiotics but existing phage therapies potentially affect both antibiotic susceptible as well as antibiotic resistant strains, destabilizing the commensal flora, which can lead to severe complications.

The trapping force further may be tuned by adjusting the amplitude and frequency of the voltage applied to the two electrodes. The localized nature of the RF field and DEP force facilitates single-particle manipulation. In operation, the tip is scanned close to the target particle. By applying a voltage across the electrodes, the ""tweezers"" tip can ""pick up"" the particle. Using a scanning or manipulating element to drive the tip motion, the particle can be moved to another desired location. The tweezers can subsequently release the particle by turning the electrode voltage off."," Electrical Engineering","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=2484","Alan Gordon, (617) 384-5000","Harvard University"
"3580","Licensable Technology","Interaction-dependent PCR: Multiplexed identification of ligand-target pairs from DNA-encoded ligand/target libraries in a single solution-phase experiment","Liu, David R.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:The rapid identification of ligands to an ever-expanding number of biological targets of interest is a major technological challenge in the life sciences. Two fundamental limitations to existing target-oriented high-throughput screening methods are (i) the requirement that each target must successively be assayed against libraries of potential ligands (limits assay throughput), and (ii) the general reliance on immobilized targets or ligands adds immobilization, washing, and/or elution steps and is a source of artifacts. A solution-phase method to simultaneously reveal all ligand-target binding pairs from a single solution containing libraries of ligands and libraries of targets could overcome both limitations and significantly increase the efficiency and effectiveness of target oriented screening efforts. Researchers in the laboratory of Professor David Liu have developed such a method, interaction-dependent PCR (IDPCR).INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:IDPCR is based on the melting temperature difference between duplex DNA formed intramolecularly versus intermolecularly. Binding of a target to its ligand would increase the effective molarity of single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides linked to the target and ligand, promoting duplex formation between complementary regions on each strand that are otherwise too short to hybridize. The resulting hairpin thus serves as a starting point for primer extension. Crucially, only the newly extended hairpin contains in a single DNA strand two primer (or primer-binding) sequences that enable subsequent PCR amplification. IDPCR therefore results in the selective amplification of those DNA sequences previously attached to, and therefore encoding, ligand-target pairs. In a model multiplex selection of a 261-member DNA-encoded ligand library with a 259-member DNA-encoded target library, designed to contain only five true ligand-target pairs out of 67,599 possible interactions, all five known ligand-target pairs were significantly enriched relative to control, with only 3 false positive signals (see figure).Overview of IDPCR: (a) A model library of DNA-encoded ligands mixed with a model library of DNA-encoded targets allows multiplexed detection of binding pairs. (b) IDPCR was used to perform a model selection on an equimolar 261-member DNA-ligand library and an equimolar 259-member DNA-target library containing five known protein-ligand pairs out of 67,599 possible combinations. For each protein target, the most highly enriched sequences (blue bars) relative to a control lacking proteins corresponded to the known protein-ligand pairs, labeled A-E in the plot. A: biotin + streptavidin (SA); B: desthiobiotin + SA; C: Gly-Leu-4-carboxy benzene sulfonamide + carbonic anhydrase II (CA), D: carboxy benzene sulfonamide + CA; E: trypsin +antipain.IDPCR represents a general method for selectively amplifying DNA sequences encoding ligand-target pairs. IDPCR can be applied to a wide variety of targets and potential ligands and can identify ligand-target pairs from libraries of small molecules and libraries of targets in a single solution. IDPCR is highly sensitive, takes place entirely in the solution phase, and can be performed in a few hours using routine equipment. A variation of this method, reactivity-dependent PCR, has been used for the multiplexed identification of molecules that undergo bond formation or cleavage. IDPCR will significantly enhance efforts to discover new ligands and targets, to reveal target-binding specificities of small molecules, and to detect low-abundance analytes."," Drug Discovery Tools  |   Research Tools","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3580","Rene Castro, (617) 495-3663","Harvard University"

Hv1 modulates B-cell activation, basophil histamine release, and acid secretion from airway epithelium and human spermatozoa. Our recent work shows that mouse and human brain microglia, but not neurons or astrocytes, expressed large Hv1-mediated currents. Hv1 was required for NOX-dependent ROS generation in brain microglia in situ and in vivo. Mice lacking Hv1 were protected from NOX-mediated neuronal death and brain damage 24 h after stroke.

"20290","Licensable Technology","Irrigation Treatment Using Alkaline Phosphatase to Detoxify Bacterial Infections","Hodin, Richard A.; Malo, Madhu S.","Technology:
The laboratory of Richard Hodin is actively developing a proprietary process to detoxify toxins released by bacteria in an open wound (e.g. surgical procedure, traumatic injury) using alkaline phosphatase as an irrigant.  Bacterial toxins such as lipopolysaccharides and flagellin can lead to increased morbidity and mortality in an individual with an infected wound.  By locally irrigating the wound with alkaline phosphatase, the inventors have demonstrated that inflammatory effects usually present in bacterial infections are inhibited and will likely result in decreased death from infection.

Applications:
- Surgery requiring an incision through the abdominal cavity/laparotomy (e.g. appendectomy, colorectal cancer, periotonitis)							-Traumatic Injury

Advantages:

This invention provides methods for identifying and controlling the growth of estrogen-responsive cells. This technology features a reporter construct that causes estrogen-responsive cells to produce green fluorescent protein when exposed to estrogen. Since the estrogen-responsive cells fluoresce upon exposure to estrogen, they may be isolated from estrogen non-responsive cells. After segregating cells in this manner, researchers used bioinformatics techniques to determine that lipocalin 2 was selectively expressed in normal estrogen-responsive mammary cells. Further, researchers determined that lipocalin 2 was able to reduce the proliferation and/ or survival of estrogen-responsive breast cancer cells. In contrast, lipocalin 2 enhanced the proliferation and/ or survival of estrogen non-responsive cells.

Applications/Advantages: As mentioned above, this technology provides a means for identifying and separating estrogen-responsive from non-responsive cells. One may inhibit the growth of estrogen-responsive cancer cells via administration of lipocalin 2; the methods of the invention are not limited to breast cancer but include lung, colon, prostate, and various gynecological cancers, as well as leukemia and lymphoma. For estrogen non-responsive cells, one may use lipocalin 2 to enhance the survival and/ or proliferation of non-malignant cells.

John","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Identification of new technologies to facilitate the development of next-generation cancer therapeutics remains a major goal of biomedical research. Development of antibody drug conjugates as new targeted therapeutics has emerged as an attractive strategy for cancer treatment in recent years. One current focus of cancer therapeutics is specific targeting of cancer cells with natural cytocidal toxins that can penetrate the cell and affect it from inside the cytosol.This technology has direct application to treating breast cancer, especially the subset that over-expresses HER2. In addition, fusing the toxin with antibodies to other cancer cell-expressed proteins could result in new methods of cancer treatment.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:This technology comes from the lab of Prof. John Collier, a world renowned leader in Anthrax research.  Scientists at the Collier lab developed an antibody targeted conjugate platform -composed of the receptor-binding domain of the Anthrax toxin fused with a  particular receptor that is present only on the  cancer cell. Proof of concept was carried out in breast cancer cells by directing the pore forming anthrax toxin to kill HER2-expressing cells, but this same system can be engineered to target other cancer receptors with great efficacy. It provides a straightforward way of redirecting the receptor specificity of the anthrax toxin, utilizing its high affinity, high penetrance rate and receptor specificity. -it is important to mention that Anthrax toxin is more useful than other toxins in creating a  natural ADC, as it is composed of three nontoxic proteins that are only toxic when mixed.

"4132","Licensable Technology","Kits For the Isolation of Pure WBCs","Kassis, Amin I.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Blood samples are routinely taken from patients to examine their white blood cell population.  This can be for a cellular count or a disease diagnosis.  The isolation of white blood cells, or WBCs, from a blood sample is therefore, a standard process in medicine as well as in many academic laboratories.  Whether it is to obtain WBC RNA or protein, to study their molecular composition, or to screen for a particular disease, it is necessary to obtain a pure population of WBCs, free from red blood cell (RBC) and plasma contamination.  Current methods often require multiple steps of RBC lysis, centifugation, and removal of the buffy coat, the layer in the gradient containing the WBC.  These steps can be imprecise and easily subject to manual error. Traditional methods, such as Ficoll or dextran, only isolate a specific subset of WBCs, rather than the whole population.  Since current methods for WBC isolation can be subjected to user error and leave behind contaminating red blood cells, Improvements in these methods could lead to advances in the downstream research.As the medical community strives for personalized medicine, examining the molecular makeup of a patient’s cells will be critical to knowing what treatment to apply.  It is likely that many molecular diagnostic tests will require a population of white blood cells from the patient, uncontaminated by red blood cells.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:This technology allows for easy isolation of a pure white blood cell population to be available for any number of downstream applications, including RNA analysis, protein analysis, metabolite detection, and immunotyping.  These methods can be used for disease diagnosis, therapeutic decisions, and occult tumor screening.

"3469","Licensable Technology","Knockout mouse model for human liver cancer","Sorger, Peter K.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Mitotic spindle checkpoint is a multi-protein network that ensures the equal segregation of chromosomes into two daughter cells during mitosis. One important component of the spindle checkpoint is MAD2 (Mitotic arrest deficient 2), whose abnormal expression has been found in human cancers. MAD2 is located on human chromosome 4q arm, which is often found to be lost in human hepatocellular carcinoma. Further more, the loss of chromosome 4q arm has been found to be associated with p53 mutations in human hepatocellular carcinomas. The line of conditional compound knockout mice of Mad2 and p53 is generated using the liver-specific albumin gene promoter to drive the expression of Cre-recombinase in liver. The single conditional Mad2 knockout mice were bred with transgenic mice which expresses albumin promoter mediated Cre to obtain liver specific Mad2 knockout mice. The liver specific Mad2 knockout mice were then bred with the single conditional p53 knockout mice to obtain liver specific double knockout mice. Detail histological analysis by hematoxylin and eosin staining has shown extensive regeneration nodules and bile duct hyperplasia as well as inflammation in both Mad2 single knockout mice and Mad2 p53 double knockout mice. The proliferation of hepatocytes was evaluated by immunohistochemical assay with antibody to Ki67, which is a cellular marker for proliferation. The expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in liver was analyzed by real time RT-PCR. The liver pathology developed in stages. The disease progressed from enlarged hepatocytes, necrosis and inflammation to nodular regeneration and bile duct proliferation. Up-regulation of several pro-inflammatory cytokines was found in the liver of Mad2-deleted mice.  Remarkably, loss of Mad2 in those mice results in hepatocellular adenoma (benign liver tumor) and hepatocellular carcinoma in 60% of animals, which is much higher than only 25% of normal mice with adenoma. The onset of tumor in those transgenic mice is also much earlier than in normal mice (age of 8 months compared with age of 23 months).  Furthermore, Mad2 deletion synergize with p53 deletion to cause malignant liver cancers in mice. Array CGH (Comparative Genomic Hybridization) shows that the liver cancers are highly aneuploid.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:While most hepatocytes in healthy liver are resting cells, deletion of Mad2 in liver activates the cell cycles and causes proliferation of hepatocytes.   Cre-mediated, simultaneous liver-specific knockout of Mad2 and p53 induces mouse cancer which share many common features of human liver cancer.  These mouse cancers arise spontaneously within a background of regenerative nodules and cirrhosis without hepatotoxic and/or carcinogenic agents.The cancer develops in stages from liver cell proliferation, fibrosis, regeneration, adenoma to malignant carcinoma, mimicking the development of human liver cancers. The cancers in this mouse model arise spontaneously without the need of hepatoxin and or carcinogens in contrast with most current mouse models of HCC (Hepatocellular Carcinoma), which depend on the administration of hepatotoxic and/or carcinogenic agents to recreate the injury-fibrosis-malignancy cycles.Mad2 and p53 compound liver specific knockout mice exhibit distinct phenotypes that closely mimic the common features of human hepatocellular carcinoma, which include hepatocyte regeneration, genomic instability and the fibrotic tumor microenvironment."," ","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3469","Rene Castro, (617) 495-3663","Harvard University"

Biofilms are implicated in many disorders of human health, and a deeper understanding of biofilms may allow them to be engineered for biomedical applications. ||

The lab of Dr. Paula Watnick, MD, PhD, at Boston Children’s Hospital has developed an innovative use of biofilms as a flexible platform for protein delivery and vaccine development. The researchers showed that functional enzymes can be fused to RbmA, a protein in the biofilm extracellular matrix. RbmA plays in an important role in multilayer biofilm formation and Dr. Watnick has observed that its main function, recruiting new cells to the biofilm, is initiated after it undergoes a proteolytic event which results in RbmA*, and is different than most extracytoplasmic proteases that cause biofilm dispersion rather than formation.                                                                                                                           
Furthermore, researchers were able to utilize biofilms to present and concentrate proteins and antigens at various biotic and abiotic surfaces. Currently, this technique is being used to develop a general diarrheal disease vaccine.||
The Watnick lab additionally studied the molecular composition of biofilms in order to give new insights into how biofilms can be disrupted in disease treatment. Researchers identified a peptide fragment produced by the proteolytic enzymes HAP, PrtV and VC0157, and they further showed that this fragment recruits additional bacteria to the biofilm surface which did not involve RbmA. This finding suggests that novel inhibitors targeting HAP, PrtV or VC0157 could be developed to help block biofilm expansion."," Therapeutics - Drugs  |   Drug Delivery","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=2853","Meyer, Abbie, abbie.meyer@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"

Alterations in cellular metabolism are now recognized as an emerging hallmark of cancer. It is increasingly appreciated that oncogenic transformation alters cellular metabolism to facilitate cell proliferation, but less is known about the metabolic changes that promote cancer cell aggressiveness. The EMT is a cellular trans-differentiation program that was first described in developmental contexts but also occurs in cancer.  After executing the EMT program, epithelial-derived cancer cells acquire traits associated with high-grade malignancy, including resistance to apoptosis and chemotherapy, dedifferentiation, and invasiveness, which can lead to metastasis. Scientists in the Sabatini lab at Whitehead Institute analyzed metabolic gene expression in cancer cell lines and found that a set of high-grade carcinoma lines expressing mesenchymal markers shared a unique gene signature, designated the “mesenchymal metabolic signature” (MMS). A FACS-based shRNA screen identified several MMS genes, including the gene that encodes dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD), as essential for the EMT but not for cell proliferation. DPYD, a pyrimidine-degrading enzyme, was highly expressed upon EMT induction and was necessary for cells to acquire mesenchymal characteristics in vitro.  In an in vivo model system, DPYD was necessary for tumorigenic cells to extravasate, a key step in metastasis. The identification of metabolic processes and genes essential for the EMT, a program associated with the acquisition of metastatic and aggressive cancer cell traits, provides new approaches to modulating the EMT and treating cancer."," Therapeutics-Methods","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867414009829","Carla DeMaria, Director, 617 258 5101, demaria@wi.mit.edu","Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research"

"2129","Licensable Technology","Lead compounds for the treatment of pain","Verdine, Gregory L.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Although peptides have shown some promise in clinical trials as therapeutic agents, their success has largely been limited by several factors, including rapid degradation by peptidases, poor cell permeability, and a lack of binding specificity resulting from conformational inflexibility.  Science has overcome these limitations with the advance of peptidomimetics--a system for the production of modified chemical compounds capable of mimicking the structural and or functional properties of peptides.  A fertile ground for such efforts lies in the discovery of ligands for nervous system receptors that mediate the sensation of pain.  Researchers at Harvard University have developed a novel approach to generate nonpeptidic ligands to a key receptor involved in pain relief, the mu opioid receptor (MOR).  This approach has far-reaching implications for the discovery of next-generation therapeutics for the treatment of pain.  The peptidomimetic mu receptor ligands generated as a result of this synthetic platform are lead compounds for the treatment of pain.  The market for pain therapeutics is very large. In one example, there are 45 million Americans that suffer from chronic headaches, while nearly 6 million reported case of chest pain.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:The invention is a novel synthetic pathway to the generation of nonpeptidic ligands for the mu opioid class of G-protein coupled receptors. The system uses stereochemical variation and acyclic geometric stereocontrol to generate diversity among its members.  The template structure (shown in 2 below) utilized to generate the stereodiversity is based upon the ligand for the mu opioid receptor (MOR), the tetrapeptide endomorphin-2.  The dense array of stereocenters in 2 combined with the rigidifying olefin generates the geometric diversity.  Sixteen stereoisomers of  2 were screened for competitive binding to MOR. The stereoisomer with the highest affinity exhibited a Ki of 8.8 nM, a value within an order of magnitude of the Ki measured for endomorphin-2.  Moreover, several compounds demonstrated a 107-600-fold selectivity for MOR over other opioid receptors, such as the delta opioid receptor (DOR) and kappa opioid receptor (KOR).  Current peptidomimetic combinatorial strategies use a single fixed scaffold that attaches varied side chains to a rigid, cyclic scaffold.  Although these libraries incorporate a large amount of structural diversity, the single fixed scaffold limits the amount of functional diversity.  This novel platform technology offers diversification through extensive stereochemical diversification.  The small molecule libraries have exhaustive variation at every sp3-hybridized center.  The system is not limited to the synthesis of libraries of peptide mimics-encompasses the broader concept of providing any collection (peptidomimetics and non-peptidomimetics) of chemical compounds having stereodiversity.  The monomers can also be obtained in high yield."," Chemical Methods/Libraries  |   Therapeutics - Drugs  |   Chemical Methods/Libraries  |   Therapeutics - Drugs","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=2129","Vivian Berlin, (617) 496-0474","Harvard University"

There is therefore a need for technology for minimizing lead contamination at locations such as skeet and trap ranges and sporting clay courses. The invention provides fabrics for containing fired lead shot. Such fabrics can be hung on poles or other such devices as a backdrop or barrier at a shooting range or course. As a result of hitting the fabric, the lead shot pellet loses all or most of its kinetic energy and thus falls to the ground near the fabric.

"109","Licensable Technology","Leukocyte Adhesion Receptors (P150, 95 Subunit)","Springer, T","Leukocytes must adhere to cellular and extracellular substrates to carry out their pivotal role in the immune system. A set of leukocyte adhesion receptors known as the ""Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1 family"" (or the ""LFA-1 family"") helps to mediate leukocyte adhesion and contains three highly related cell surface glycoproteins. This invention provides the alpha-subunit of one of these glycoproteins, the p150,95 receptor molecule. This technology features the adhesion molecule itself, functional fragments of the molecule, and corresponding nucleic acids.

Applications/Advantages: Agents which interfere with the binding of the p150,95 receptor to its ligand may provide anti-inflammatory action. For example, monoclonal antibodies directed against the p150,95 alpha-subunit can be used to prevent the binding of leukocytes to endothelial cells, and thus may be employed as anti-inflammatory agents. Likewise, using the methods provided by this technology, one may prepare and assay fragments of the p150,95 alpha-subunit to determine whether there are antagonists of cellular adhesion. The invention accordingly holds promise in treating inflammation associated with an array of conditions including multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, graft and transplant rejection, and Crohn's disease."," Drug Discovery Tools","http://www.dfci.harvard.edu/res/technology/available.asp?case_number=28&keywords=&category_id=3&category_name=Research+Reagents","Ruth Emyanitoff, Phone (617) 632-4010, Fax (617) 632-4012, Email Ruth_Emyanitoff@dfci.harvard.edu","Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"
"3694","Licensable Technology","Leveraging bacterial spores to generate and store energy","Sahin, Ozgur","MARKETS ADDRESSED:On wet surfaces and open water, evaporation provides an effective way to release the heat coming from solar radiation to the surrounding air. Under dry atmospheric conditions evaporation also allows for doing useful work. In nature, trees harness this phenomenon to transport water from soil to the leaves. These processes have inspired engineered systems that have demonstrated novel capabilities as actuators, pumps, and even as energy scavengers and biological sensors. However, the prospects of natural evaporation in providing utility scale renewable energy have not received attention thus far. The present invention used bacterial spores that show promise for efficient and sustainable energy conversion from evaporation with low cost and scalable device architectures. This technique provides a unique way to generate energy near water sources (run-off, sea water etc.), especially at remote, off-the-grid locations and storing generated energy in a convenient, low-maintenance form factor that can released at appropriate environment to do work. Additional applications include scavenging the heat released from human body to power micro-electronic devices and latent heat capture for use in next generation, energy efficient, sustainable buildings.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:For evaporation to become an economically feasible source of renewable energy, useful work needs to be generated with high efficiency, long term sustained performance, and preferably without consuming fresh water. Bacterial spores are dormant cells that can withstand harsh environmental conditions for long period of time and still maintain biological functionality. The spores are extremely dynamic structures that can respond to change in relative humidity (RH) in the environment by expanding and shrinking their diameter anisotropically by as much as 12%. By assembling a single layer of spores on a rubber sheet, researchers at Harvard demonstrated the transfer of more than one Joule to each square meter of rubber as the spores dried at low RH. The resulting forces were strong enough to generate electricity by bending a piezoelectric transducer. Furthermore, spores sustained their energy conversion performance even after a million cycles of high and low relative humidity. The demonstrated speed and efficiency of energy conversion may permit generating renewable energy from natural evaporation across open water with low cost rubber based devices at an area power density comparable to existing renewable energy technologies. Comparing to traditional tidal and wave based energy generation technologies, this invention do not require significant current flow and can be more broadly applied to anywhere standing water exists. This makes it ideal for remote, off-the-grid power generation for small energy consumption devices."," Energy  |   Environment","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3694","Alan Gordon, (617) 384-5000","Harvard University"
"2440","Licensable Technology","Lift-off patterning processes using solid-condensed-gas layers as resists","Golovchenko, Jene","MARKETS ADDRESSED:These inventions (see also case 2310) involve the use of gases directly solidified onto cryogenically cooled substrates to form conformal thin films as resists for lithographically patterning the substrates.  Examples of such gases are water vapor and rare gases, such as argon.  Water as a resist is placed on the substrate directly from the gas phase, patterned with an energetic beam (electron, ion or light), and then the rest is removed by sublimation.  Electron or ion beams were shown to sublimate water ice from silicon substrates and to allow the patterning of the substrate with sub-20nm metal lines. This excellent resolution was accomplished without any attempts to optimize the process and with 5nm diameter beams and can likely be improved. The use of frozen gaseous resists appears not to suffer from the proximity effects seen with polymer resists which lessen the pattern resolution available with polymer resists. Another use of the frozen gaseous resists is to hold 1D substrates rigid allowing them to be cut. Carbon nanotubes coated with water ice were easily cut using an ion beam - this is a major advance in the field because previously there was no reliable way of cutting nanotubes at predetermined locations.  A further surprising discovery is that some resists and substrates can chemically react in the presence of the energy released by the beam and leave a thin film of reactant in a pattern determined by the beam. Water as a resist on silicon substrate and then exposed to an electron beam left a thin coating of silicon oxide.  This discovery opens up a new way of placing a very thin film of silica dielectric in any predetermined pattern and could be very useful in the microelectronics fabrication.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:This technology has numerous advantages over standard polymer resists such as: a) gentler conditions (no spinning on of slurries, no baking at elevated temperatures, no exposure to liquid surface tension), b) economic (fewer steps, no expensive polymer resists and no toxic solvents to dispose), c) broader array of substrates can be patterned from standard 2D planar inorganic substrates to 3D fragile substrates such as biological substrates to 1D substrates such as nanotubes and nanowires,  d) cleaner processing (all steps occur in a single vacuum chamber, removal of unexposed condensed gasses leaves minimal residues)."," Communications  |   Nanotechnology  |   Materials  |   Physics","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=2440","Alan Gordon, (617) 384-5000","Harvard University"

"20718","Licensable Technology","Lipid Biomarkers Predict Early Type 2 Diabetes Risk","Gerszten, Robert E; Wang, Thomas J.; Clish, Clary ; Rhee, Eugene","Technology:
Investigators at Massachusetts General Hospital/Broad Institute have developed a sensitive method to determine risk of developing diabetes. A liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry-based profiling strategy was used to measure lipids in around 400 individuals, with over 12 years of follow up. They identified a lipidomic signature of diabetes risk, most notable among triacylglycerols (TAGs), which persisted after multivariable adjustments.
 By combining the positive and negative risk information from two select TAGs, they are able to identify individuals with a greater than 5-fold increased risk of future disease; above and beyond the information provided by age, sex, BMI, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, total triglycerides, and HDL cholesterol.

Applications:
- Early prediction of (at risk) populations can guide lifestyle modifications and therapy.
- Prediction of diabetes risk can lead to early intervention and lowered morbidity.
- Lipid profiling may enable patient stratification for clinical trials and therapy.

Advantages:
- Rapid outpatient procedure, as it relies on lipid measurements in baseline serum i.e. No OGTT or other test need be administered to the patient.
- Improvement over the standard clinical measurement of triacylglycerols, which relies on the measurement of total glycerol in serum analysis
- Possibility to automate assays

"4272","Licensable Technology","Liquid color: Flexible, angle-independent structural color from microdroplets","Manoharan, Vinothan","MARKETS ADDRESSED:The future breakthroughs in display technology are in reflective, color displays. The ideal display will be low-power, thin, light and flexible, producing bright colors with high contrast and high viewing angles. These parameters have not been met with traditional LCD/LED display technologies which are used in everything from televisions to cell phones. Current reflective display technologies are also either low in efficiency or do not have color capability. Thus, research into efficient reflective color display technologies is still ongoing. One innovative concept, which could be incorporated into devices of the next generation of displays, is structural color.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:This invention uses microdroplets with particle arrays (“photonic balls”) to achieve angle-independent structural color. When incident light is reflected off the disordered arrangement of scattering centers in the microdroplets, only certain wavelengths are reflected back, giving the appearance of color. In this invention, the size and spacing of these scatterers can be independently controlled, allowing for fine tuning of the light reflected from these scatterers to produce pure, saturated colors of narrow wavelengths. The invention also allows for enhancement of colors (i.e. red) not typically seen in structural color devices. The color is high in efficiency and does not rely on filtering for color selectivity. The coloration can be achieved with a wide range of chemicals and could be incorporated into flexible, low-power reflective displays.Also, unlike traditional (sometimes toxic) pigmentary-based colorants currently used for commercial cosmetics and paint products, structural color can create a wide range of colors while using a limited number of material chemistries.

"3507","Licensable Technology","Localized bioprobes for electrophysiology","Lieber, Charles M.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Ion channels currently represent a less well charted territory of druggable targets than cell-surface receptors and enzymes, but this is changing. The electrophysiological techniques traditionally used to study ion-channel activity (one-cell, one-pipette patch clamping) are too slow for screening drug candidates, but some companies are finding ways to adapt and automate these techniques. One factor driving this development is the requirement by the regulatory authorities that all drugs must be tested for possible effects on a cardiac potassium channel (the hERG channel), which can cause cardiac arrhythmia. Compounds with adverse effects need to be weeded out as early as possible in the drug-discovery process.Patch clamp has been an essential tool in the study of ion channels. Drug discovery, however often requires high throughput methods given the large number of compounds in compound libraries that must be screened. Conventional patch clamp has the following disadvantages: chemical invasive, mechanical invasive and high impedance. In addition, it remains a low efficiency technique such that even a skilled patch clamper can record data from only 20-30 cells during an 8-hour work day. In response to this major limitation, several companies have developed automated patch clamp systems that can record from hundreds to thousands of cells a day. However, it’s only suitable for recording from cell lines with stable, high expression of the ion channel of interest. In addition, it lacks protocol flexibility for academic applications. Researchers in the laboratory of Charles M. Lieber have developed a free-standing nanoscale field effect transistors enabled by designed kinked nanowire structures. It can achieve point-like three-dimensional sensing and recording, and monitor intracellular potential change inside single cells.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Nanoelectronic devices offer substantial potential for interrogating biological systems, although nearly all work has focused on planar device designs. The inventors have overcome this limitation through synthetic integration of a nanoscale field effect transistor (nanoFET) device at the tip of an acuteangle kinked silicon nanowire, where nanoscale connections are made by the arms of the kinked nanostructure and remote multilayer interconnects allow three-dimensional (3D) probe presentation. The acute-angle probe geometry was designed and synthesized by controlling cis versus trans crystal conformations between adjacent kinks, and the nanoFET was localized through modulation doping. 3D nanoFET probes exhibited conductance and sensitivity in aqueous solution independent of large mechanical deflections, and demonstrated high pH sensitivity. Additionally, 3D nanoprobes modified with phospholipid bilayers can enter single cells to allow robust recording of intracellular potentials. The invention has the following advantages. It’s easy to use compared to conventional patch clamp. Its tip size is much smaller and can reach places where current technology cannot. Current patch clamp tip is about 2um. The reported nano-FET is about 80 nm. Their recent fabrication in the lab is of 15 nm. In addition, it’s chemical and mechanical non-invasive. Last but not least, it provides more flexibility for academic users than automated patch clamp technology."," Research Tools  |   Nanotechnology/NEMS  |   Research Tools  |   Nanotechnology/NEMS  |   Research Tools  |   Nanotechnology/NEMS  |   Research Tools  |   Nanotechnology/NEMS  |   Research Tools","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3507","Mick Sawka, (617) 496-3830","Harvard University"

The filter receives and processes the input signal vector X to attenuate noise from non-target sources and provides an output signal vector Y. Tap weights W.sub.N for the filter are selected by first parameterizing each of the tap weights W.sub.N, such that each of the tap weights W.sub.N is characterized by a vector of parameters .beta..sub.opt, and the solving for each parameter of the vector .beta..sub.opt by minimizing the expected power of the array output signal Y. A robustness-control transformation is then applied to the vector p to provide a robust vector .beta..sub.opt wherein the robustness-control transformation identifies and reduces target canceling components of the vector .beta..sub.opt while preserving non-target canceling components. Finally, the weight vector indicative of the filter tap weights is formed as a function of the vector .beta..sub.opt. Notably, the present invention separates the robustness constraining process from the beamforming power minimization, in contrast to prior art techniques which combine the robustness constraint into the beamforming power minimization.

TNP-470 showed promise in oncology development but Phase II trials were interrupted because of reversible neurotoxicity, poor oral availability and a short half-life. ||

Dr. Ofra Benny-Ratsaby has developed a formulation, called Lodamin, which potentially solves all of these limitations. Lodamin is a conjugate of TNP-470 to PEG and PLA polymers and forms micelles with TNP-470 at its core, allowing for oral availability and for delivery to the tumor where the drug is slowly released. Lodamin exhibited anti-angiogenic activity in vivo and inhibited primary tumor growth in mouse models of melanoma, lung, breast, brain and ovarian cancers by more than 80% without neurotoxicity or other adverse events. Importantly, Lodamin also prevented melanoma-derived liver metastases, a condition which is incurable in humans, and prolonged survival in mice."," Therapeutics - Drugs","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=1601","Dietz, Ryan, ryan.dietz@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"

But the existing electroporation techniques demand very high operation voltage (>1000 V), which makes instrumentation complicated and expensive, and causes cell death due to arcing events. Also, current methods do not work well with small cells, such as neurons. This invention, which uses nanowire forests for electroporation, can solve many of these issues, and lead to a variety of potential implementations: 1.     High-throughput delivery of biomolecules (e.g., DNA, RNA or protein) into all types of cells, large cells like E. coli and yeast cells, as well as small ones like stem cells and neurons.2.     Site-specific biomolecular delivery within networks or systems of interacting cells. By constructing individually addressable nanowire electrodes, different sites of interest in the same cell or different cells within a network can be located and excited to intake biomolecules. 3.     Different molecules can be repetitively or sequentially delivered to the same cells at different time points. These cells can remain on the nanostructured electrode between electroporations and still preserve their viability.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Professor Hongkun Park’s lab has created a nanowire array structure for electroporation. This platform consists of vertically aligned silicon nanowire arrays coated with electrically conductive material such as Au, Pt, or Ag. Individually addressable nanowire electrodes are also available via semiconductor processing. Target cells are cultured a top the nanowire electrodes that partially penetrate into the cells. Electroporation is achieved by applying an electric potential across the nanowire electrode and a metal electrode, both of which are immersed in a bath solution containing the biomolecule of interest. Due to the dramatically enhanced electric field strength between the tip of nanowire and metal electrode, only a few volts are needed to deliver biomolecules into target cells. The delivery efficiency can be optimized by finely tuning the nanowire density, aspect ratio and radius of curvature. The nanowire platform has been successfully demonstrated on both easy to transfect cells (HEK cells) and hard to transfect cells (neurons). When delivering a membrane-impermeable dye molecules into HEK293 cells, we have reached a greater than 97% efficiency and more than 85% cell viability. Comparable efficiency and viability have also been achieved on neurons. In contrast, the commercial electroporation systems typically report ~70-90% efficiency for easy to transfect cells, and ~20-50% for hard to transfect cells."," Instrumentation  |   Nanotechnology/NEMS  |   Instrumentation  |   Nanotechnology/NEMS  |   Instrumentation","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=4095","Mick Sawka, (617) 496-3830","Harvard University"

However, measurements of these fluctuations via the ubiquitous power spectral density (PSD) are restricted in frequency by instrument limitations stemming from the acquisition rate and detector frequency response. While common to all instruments, these limitations can be especially detrimental to video applications (e.g. video microscopy, single molecule measurements, microrheology), where camera frame rates are often intrinsically slow or are necessarily slowed to accommodate long exposure times (e.g. fluorescence imaging). These pervasive limitations are manifested in the inability to make certain high-frequency measurements, or in the significant expense required to upgrade to faster measurement equipment.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Harvard researchers have developed a new method for determining the PSD of a signal that dramatically extends the effective detection bandwidth of current instruments. The invention circumvents previous limitations of acquisition rate and detector frequency bandwidth by modulating the signal before detection or sampling. The bandwidth of this new system is governed by the maximum modulation frequency, enabling the power spectrum of a signal to be measured above the Nyquist limit (half of the acquisition rate). This dramatic increase in bandwidth can be used to push the envelope of high frequency measurement and to realize significant cost savings in instrumentation. As an example, the method was used to transform a standard video camera into a spectrum analyzer with a frequency range of up to ~300 kHz, simply by modulating an LED light source."," Photonics/Optical Systems  |   Instrumentation","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3120","Laura Brass, (617) 495-3067","Harvard University"

"1247","Licensable Technology","Low-power, high-speed transducer detects forces at the nano-scale","Westervelt, Robert M.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Most commercially available strain measuring transducers are silicon-based.  Silicon-based sensors require roughly one milliwatt of power for operation, which limits the size of the cantilever and, therefore its potential frequency and imaging speed. Cantilevers fabricated with Gallium Arsenide Field Effect Transistors (GaAs FETs) have very low power dissipation (10 µW), allowing the cantilever to be scaled to extremely small dimensions (3 x 2 x 0.129 µm3). These dimensions enable the cantilever to operate at high resonant frequencies (11 MHz), thereby increasing its capacity to scan at high speeds.Many commercial strain measuring transducers also use displacement sensors which operate separately from the cantilever, limiting sensitivity as size is reduced.  Because the GaAs FET is incorporated directly into the cantilever structure, it is referred to as ""self-sensing"".  This type of sensor gains force sensitivity as the size of the structure is reduced.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:A strain-sensing transducer designed for detecting small forces in micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) and nano-electromechanical systems (NEMS) has been reduced to practice and awarded a patent.  Because it is fabricated with piezoelectric semiconducting materials, this transducer achieves higher speed and sensitivity than commercial transducers, which are typically made from piezoresistive materials.The transducer is built with a field-effect transistor (FET) made from a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure containing a near surface two dimensional electron gas. The FET is etched into the base of a cantilever arm. A variable physical force applied to the cantilever subjects the FET to a variable strain, creating a piezoelectric effect. This effect results in an electrical response to the applied strain."," ","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=1247","Alan Gordon, (617) 384-5000","Harvard University"

"03004","Licensable Technology","Magnetic Resonance Inverse Imaging","Lin, Fa-Hsuan","The Technology:
This technology is a method for acquiring MR image data and for reconstructing images from such data that enables the elimination of one or more imaging gradients. More specifically, the method includes acquiring NMR data from the field of view using multiple coils and corresponding multiple receive channels and combining the data from the multiple coils using an imaging inverse operator derived from a forward model that accounts for the NMR signals received by each coil and its associated receive channel. A major strength of this invention is the shortening of the scan time by reducing reliance on imaging gradients. By eliminating one, two or three imaging gradients using the present invention, the pulse sequence used to acquire NMR image data is shortened and the number of repetitions of the pulse sequence is either reduced or eliminated altogether. Unlike prior parallel MRI imaging methods, the imaging inverse operator also allows reconstruction in the underdetermined case: where the rate of the accelerated image exceeds the number of RF array channels. The effective rate (reciprocal of the ratio of sampled k-space points to that needed for an unaliased reconstruction) can exceed the number of RF array channels present. If the gradient encoding is completely eliminated (one k-space sample) then the present invention can generate an image solely using the spatial information in the array of multiple receive coils.

The inverse imaging is built on the following technologies:
MGH 3536: the fundamental mathematical framework to bring regularization and to estimate an optimal number for parallel imaging reconstruction
MGH 3004: the core of the inverse imaging acquisition and image reconstruction with minimum-norm estimates.
MGH 3379: the spatial filter image reconstruction algorithm for the inverse imaging for higher sensitivity
MGH 3380: the preprocessing procedure to suppress noises from inverse imaging acquisitions to improve data quality.
MGH 3301: regularized k-space reconstruction algorithm without sacrificing the spatial resolution using traditional parallel MRI reconstruction

Application:
This technology is particularly useful in fMRI applications, but it is also useful in other applications where very high temporal resolution is needed, such as image registration in the interventional MRI setting. This technology can be also used to improve fMRI sensitivity by suppressing physiological noises without external monitoring device. For simultaneous EEG and MRI acquisition, this method can allow for minimal gradient contaminating artifacts. Ultra-fast 2D or 3D spectroscopic imaging can be achieved by inverse imaging to obtain brain metabolite information with a large spatial coverage. And it can also be generalized to quite or silent MRI scanning. This technology can be combined with almost all MR contrast preparation procedure.

Advantages:   
-Fastest MRI scanning technique available 
-Significant reduction of motion artifacts 
-Significant reduction of gradient-related artifacts
-Significant improvement on fMRI sensitivity
-Allows scanning of children and patients that usually required anesthesia without the use of anesthetics 
-Allows quiet or silent MR scanning

"4396","Licensable Technology","Mapping the Behaviorome: Comprehensive, quantitative, and unbiased visualization of defined behavior states","Datta, Sandeep Robert","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Animal behavior in response to external stimuli has, in the past, been visualized only by human observation and by recording quasi-qualitative behaviors.  For example, the formalin test, and in vivo model of pain, is used to determine the analgesic effect of a compound.  A formalin injected mouse paw is observed for a pain-like response, which includes licks, twitches, raising, or shaking.  Such a test is inherently qualitative, and requires constant human supervision.By creating a quantitative 3D visualization of the behaviorome, the automated capture of a drug’s effect on behavior is possible.  The effect of a potential drug on existing mouse models, particularly neurobehaviorial models, or wild-type mice can be easily tested against the established behaviorome to determine early efficacy or off-target effects. Furthermore, this technology can be used for target identification or validation by evaluating a knockout or knockdown’s effect on wild-type behavior.Quantitative behaviorome profiling has the potential to be transformative for biomedicine, particularly in neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. To elucidate the behaviorome in these disease states, researchers are identifying strain-to-strain variation in behavior and identify genes that specify both simple and complex features of behavior.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:While profiling and mapping of the genome, transcriptome, and interactome has yielded new insights in disease pathways and potential opportunities to modulate those pathways, little is known about the behaviorome.  The behaviorome is the complete complement of behaviors generated by an animal in a given context and is comprised of two components; the full set of actions exhibited by an animal and the statistical rules that govern how those actions are assembled to generate behavior.  Because the behaviorome is the result of both hardwiring and experience, characterizing these behaviors may provide fundamental insight into the neural mechanisms that allow animals to navigate the outside world.Automated and Quantitative 3D Visualization of Animal Behavior:  To date, no method has been established that comprehensively quantifies the actions of an animal and identifies the statistics that govern how these actions are assembled into a behavior.  Researchers at Harvard Medical School have created a 3D machine vision system that reveals, for the first time, the actions and action assembly statistics that define the behaviorome.  The system uses depth cameras to image and capture the 3D morphology of a mouse in real-time as it behaves, as well as capturing information about probabilities of further actions.  Using this method, researchers are able to generate graphical representations of a behavioral state and define particular sequences of states that together constitute specific complex behaviors."," Therapeutics - Drugs  |   Therapeutics - Methods","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=4396","Michal Preminger, (617) 432-0920","Harvard University"

Approximately 28,000 patients with pancreatic cancer are diagnosed each year, and nearly all of these patients will die of their disease. The poor prognosis of this malignancy is a result of the difficulty of early diagnosis and poor response to current therapeutic methods. In particular, no tumor markers are currently identified that allow reliable screening at an early, potentially curable stage of the disease. Because the molecular basis underlying the pathogenesis of pancreatic adenocarcinomas remain largely unknown, the disease has an extremely poor prognosis and lacks early diagnostic and therapeutic modalities. The invention is based on the discovery that two proteins expressed in the pancreas may be correlated to risk of pancreatic cancer. These proteins are known to be down-regulated in certain other cancer types, but it was not previously known that either protein is down-regulated in pancreatic cancer. The invention features methods of diagnosing pancreatic cancer, or the risk of developing pancreatic cancer, by detecting the levels of one or both of the biomarkers: lower levels of the protein would be indicative of increased risk. These markers are also expected to be useful in distinguishing pancreatic cancer from gastric cancer. In addition, these proteins are potential targets for therapeutic intervention against pancreatic cancer, in that agents that enhance their expression might be useful to treat cancer, and may also be useful markers or targets for other diseases relating to pancreatic growth and function."," Diagnostics/Biomarkers","http://www.joslinresearch.org/inventions","David J.

Dysregulation of protein kinase signaling pathways is a hallmark of many human diseases, including cancer. Measuring normal or abnormal kinase activity is important to understanding the biology of these diseases.  Although the regulation and functions of many individual kinases are well understood, high-throughput methods to assess the activity of the full complement of protein kinases, the kinome, remain scarce.  The screen includes peptides associated with certain cancers, cardiac conditions and inflammatory conditions, making the assay useful for diagnosis and prognosis, as well as for patient stratification for clinical trials.  This assay could also be used for discovery research to profile kinase activity in disease tissues, discover new targets for kinase inhibitors, and establish relationships between the activity of particular kinases and clinical outcomes.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:This technology is a new generation, high-throughput assay to quantitatively assess the activity of the kinome in a variety of samples.  Cocktails of synthetic peptides are combined with a sample of interest and phosphorylated by kinases in the sample. The degree of phosphorylation is then measured by ultra-high resolution mass-spectrometry.  The methods optimize the speed and accuracy of high-throughput mass spectrometry analysis.  For example, the peptides in the cocktail are enriched with stable isotopes to enhance the ionization efficiency.  The end result is an assay capable of measuring the activity of kinases from single cells. Combined with cell sorting, this assay could provide a powerful means to analyze subsets of cells from tissue samples.The lab is currently working to expand the peptide cocktail and is seeking collaborators to apply the technology to disease diagnosis and prognosis."," Drug Discovery Tools","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=2963","Grant Zimmermann, (617) 495-3067","Harvard University"

Using a mouse model, they showed that administration of MMPIs prevented the development of fatty liver disease in animals given a diet associated with fat-induced liver damage.  Livers of control and experimental animals were evaluated both physically and chemically, and while the animals on the high-fat diet alone developed abnormal liver features, those treated with MMP inhibitors did not. Both the physical features of the liver and chemical liver marker levels in the MMP-treated animals were normal, indicating not only that the MMP inhibitor prevented the development of fat particles in the organ but also protected the cellular function of the hepatocytes. ||

Fatty liver disease is the precursor to major liver damage, including liver inflammation, scarring, cirrhosis and liver failure. The major causes of fatty liver disease are obesity and diabetes, both of which are on the rise in the United States and elsewhere. The number of people with excessive fat accumulation in the liver is increasing and is estimated to be 30% of the population in both Western European countries and the United States. Up to 10% of this population, 3% of all adults, will develop serious liver disease, including cirrhosis.

Mechanisms are simple and mechanically robust. They may have as few as one actuator, which excites the compliant portion to vibrate in a natural mode that results in motion that mimics a living animal. Additional actuators may drive directional elements such as flippers. Models for compliant mechanism bodies were derived and used to identify actuator, material, and geometrical properties of the required mechanisms. The design and fabrication techniques of mechanisms implementing these ideas is also presented. Experiments found that important features of fish-swimming kinematics can be captured qualitatively by compliant mechanisms. The resulting mechanism swimming performance was 1/3 of the real fish performance, comparable to current robotic fish. A compliant mechanism approach to biomimetic locomotion has significant advantages since mechanisms are simpler and more robust than traditional mechanisms used for biomimetic robots and performance achieved is comparable.

In arteriosclerosis, a form of vascular disease, arterial walls become thickened and their internal diameters constrict. This constriction leads to increased blood pressure and reduced circulation. A severe form of arteriosclerosis is atherosclerosis, whose hallmark is the formation of plaques composed of lipid (especially low density lipoprotein or LDL) and cells that may completely block blood flow, causing stroke, heart attack or damage to other tissues due to loss of circulation.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Issued patents claim DNA encoding the SmLIM polypeptide and/or promoter sequence, and the SmLIM polypeptide.

Although involved in regulation of color change in fish, it is localized in the ventral aspect of the Zona Incerta and the lateral hypothalamus in mammals, and was suspected to play a role in complex mammalian behaviors. MCH has been shown to regulate eating behavior in mammals. Specifically, MCH is known to stimulate feeding in rodents, while animals lacking the MCH gene are lean. This molecule and/or its receptor are therefore potentially useful targets for therapeutic intervention to control weight gain or eating behavior. The available technology features transgenic mice, engineered with the MCH gene knocked out. This mouse model is useful in drug screening and development in the field of appetite control."," Research Reagents","http://www.joslinresearch.org/inventions","David J.

"T001499","Licensable Technology","MEMS Microphone Array","Robert D. White","Tufts University Categories:engineering:aerospacesemiconductor:MEMssensorsAdditional Keywords:(none specified)Invention SummaryBackground:As aircraft noise regulations become more stringent, the need for modeling and measuring aircraft noise phenomena becomes more important. In order to intelligently design quieter aircraft, the physical mechanisms of noise generation should be understood and any theoretical or computational noise model should be experimentally validated. One validation method is the comparison of the theoretical and measured acoustic far-field pressures. However, single microphone measurements of aeroacoustic sources in wind tunnels are hampered by poor signal to noise ratios that arise from microphone wind self-noise, tunnel system drive noise, reverberation, and electromagnetic interference. In addition, a single microphone cannot distinguish pressure contributions from different source locations. The need for more precise noise source characterization and localization has driven the development of advanced sound field measurement techniques. In particular, the development and application of directional (phased) microphone arrays have been documented as a means to localize and characterize aeroacoustic sources in the presence of high background noise.Invention:The sensor covered by this invention is novel due to the use of a fully surface micromachined foundry process, a microphone array on a single chip with a fine center-to-center pitch, and front venting. The pressure sensor array has a center-to-centerpitch of 1.2625 mm with a membrane diameter of 600 microns (shown in Figure 4). Due to this the sensor will be able to provide high resolution data on the frequency wavenumber spectra of the TBL experienced by an aircraft in flight. Also, by assembling the array chips end-to-end, this sensor will be able to determine low wavenumber information through the larger spatial scale."," Mechanical Engineering  |   Sensing/Imaging  |   Mechanical Engineering","http://www.tufts.biz/cgi-bin/tech_search.cgi?r=1&case=T001499","Martin Son617-636-3605martin.son@tufts.edu","Tufts University"

Inventors in the cardiology division at MGH and BU have developed metabolic biomarkers to determine the risk of developing diabetes. A liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry (LC/MS)-based profiling strategy was used to measure 60 metabolites in baseline serum samples from over 2000 people. They discovered metabolite levels are altered in serum, presaging the onset of type 2 Diabetes by up to 12 years. 

Amino acids such as Leucine, Isoleucine, Valine, Phenylalanine and Tyrosine differed significantly in the fasting serum of controls versus future diabetics. People with 5 elevated amino acids had a 2- to 4-fold increased risk of developing diabetes, while individuals in the top quartile for a combination of three amino acids (Ile, Phe, Tyr) had a 5- to 7-fold increased risk of developing diabetes over 12 years. These findings allow us to identify individuals with an increased risk of future disease, above and beyond the information provided by age, sex, BMI, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and dietary intake. 

Applications:
- Prediction of diabetes in at-risk patients may lead to early intervention, lifestyle modification, lower morbidity and healthcare costs.
- Metabolic profiling may enable patient stratification, for clinical trials and therapy monitoring.

Advantages:
- Rapid outpatient procedure, relies on measuring metabolites in baseline serum i.e. No OGTT or other test needs be administered to the patient.
- Serum analyses for amino acids are simple to conduct.
- Kit; Possible to automate assays

A feedforward circuit is used to form an estimate of a current co-channel interference value from co-channel interference values occurring on previous scan lines. The estimate is subtracted from the signal to remove the co-channel interference at the expense of generating intersymbol interference. The circuit uses a form of decision-feedback equalization (DFE) in order to remove the intersymbol interference. The periodicity of the NTSC signal is exploited to allow the use of a high-rate trellis code in the DFE circuit."," ","http://www.ipvisioninc.com/findurl.php?uid=mitDossier:6193","Jack Turner","Massachusetts Institute of Technology"

"02578","Licensable Technology","Method and Apparatus for Dermatologic Treatment (Line Scan and Resurfacing)","Manstein, Dieter ; Anderson, Richard Rox","Background:

Skin is primarily made of two layers.  The outer layer, or epidermis, has a depth of approximately 100?m.  The inner layer, or dermis, has a depth of approximately 3,000?m from the outer surface of the skin.  

There is ongoing demand for procedures to improve skin defects.  Such improvements may include reducing wrinkles or reducing any abnormality or irregularity of skin color (dyschromia) resulting from irregular pigment distribution or dilated blood vessels.  Conventional methods for performing improvements like those mentioned above include ablative skin resurfacing (ASR) and non-ablative skin resurfacing (NSR).

ASR is considered to be an effective laser treatment for repairing skin.  In ASR, a region of the epidermis and a corresponding region of the dermis beneath it are thermally damaged to promote wound healing.  However, ASR has many side effects, which include pain, oozing, erythema (abnormal redness and inflammation), and pigment disturbance.  In addition, the risk of scarring and infection are quite high, and recovery time is often prolonged.

In NSR, selective portions of dermal tissue are heated to induce wound healing without damaging the epidermis above.  Selective dermal damage that leaves the epidermis undamaged is achieved by a combination of laser treatment and properly timed superficial skin cooling.  NSR is only moderately effective for wrinkle removal and is generally not effective for dyschromia.  One advantage of NSR is that it does not have the undesirable side effects that are characteristic of the ASR treatment.

In view of the disadvantages and limitations of ASR and NSR stated above, there is an increasing demand for an effective and safe treatment that repairs or alleviates skin defects.

 
Technology:

The present invention relates to methods and apparatus for the improvement of skin defects.  More specifically, it is directed to a method known as fractional resurfacing which uses electromagnetic radiation (EMR) produced by one or more individual point sources or mechanical means to damage selected regions of the skin and thereby promote beneficial results by stimulation of wound healing and tissue remodeling.  The apparatus includes a damaging means for causing cell death in dermal tissue, and an optional control unit for controlling the damaging means, which may be used to create a plurality of micro-lines of damaged regions in the dermal tissue of interest.  In addition, this approach may facilitate the delivery of drugs into the skin.

The unique aspect of this invention is the application of selective dermal damage in particular patterns in combination with superficial skin cooling to promote effective and fast wound healing.  This combination of elements achieves the desired skin resurfacing while leaving the epidermis undamaged.

Applications:

-     Improvement of skin defects such as wrinkles and dyschromia.

Advantages:

-  Provides a safe and effective treatment for a variety of visible skin defects.
-  Operational parameters of the apparatus can be varied over a wide range.
-  Minimizes the risk of scarring and greatly reduces adverse side effects and healing time.
-  Apparatus and methods are relatively simple to manufacture and use.
-  Combines the best features of ASR and NSR, while minimizing their respective defects.

First, a system is determined to be either nonlinear or linear. If the system is determined to be nonlinear, then noise of increasing intensity is incrementally added to a data set representing the analyzed system until the resulting test signal appears to be linear. If the noise limit of the resulting test signal is significantly greater than zero, then the system is determined to be chaotic and the amount of noise added to the data set provides an indication of the relative strength of the chaos. Alternatively, if the noise limit of the resulting test signal is approximately zero, then the system is determined to be nonlinear with periodic or quasi-periodic limit cycles. An optional power spectrum test is described with which it can be confirmed that the system is nonlinear with periodic or quasi-periodic limit cycles."," ","http://www.ipvisioninc.com/findurl.php?uid=mitDossier:7707","Jose Estabil","Massachusetts Institute of Technology"

In its simplest form, the structure comprises an electrical load and a pair of electrodes connected thereto. The electrodes are spaced apart (by air or other dielectric medium). A signal generator, which acts as a ""reader,"" is connected to a larger electrode that may be embedded in an environmental surface. When the structure is placed in proximity to the reader electrode, application of the signal results in capacitive coupling between the reader and the electrodes of the structure. The structure is not detected by the reader, however, because the capacitive coupling is comparable for both electrodes, so the load experiences only a small electrical gradient. But if one of the electrodes is grounded, this symmetry is broken and current is drawn through the load. In general, grounding occurs when a person, coupled (even weakly) to environmental ground--e.g., by virtue of standing on the floor--touches one of the electrodes. The resulting loading, which may be varied over time by the structure, is detected by the signal generator."," ","http://www.ipvisioninc.com/findurl.php?uid=mitDossier:8334T","Jack Turner","Massachusetts Institute of Technology"

This invention has broad assay/diagnostic potential for use in determining the extent of interaction and/or inactivation between a cyclin/cdk inhibitor and the HPV E7 oncoprotein and thus for evaluating the proliferative state of a transformed cell.  The invention may also be used to identify therapeutic compounds capable of inhibiting the interaction between a cyclin/cdk inhibitor and HPV E7, as well as compounds capable of inhibiting growth of an HPV-associated cancer cell.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Human papillomaviruses (HPV's) are small DNA viruses of the papovavirus family that infect human epithelial cells.  ""Low risk"" HPV's can cause benign hyperplasia's such as genital warts, while ""high risk"" HPV's, e.g., HPV-16 and HPV-18 can cause carcinomas such as cervical or penile carcinoma.  Two HPV encoded proteins, E6 and E7, known as viral oncoproteins are consistently expressed in the cancers and lead to transformation of infected cells.  The transforming functions of the papillomaviruses reflect their ability to interfere with control mechansims that govern the normal program of cellular growth and differentiation. The HPV E6 oncoprotein interacts with the nuclear phosphoprotein p53 which is believed to act as a tumor suppressor in its native state by functioning as a key mediator of DNA repair.  The HPV E7 oncoprotein has been shown to interact with p21Cip1 and overcomes p21Cip1 inhibition of the kinase activity of cyclin/cdk complexes. p21Cip1 has been recognized as a major mediator of the p53 suppressor protein.   Increased levels of p53, as a response to a cellular challenge such as DNA damage, enhance the synthesis of p21Cip1.  As a direct consequence of the higher p21Cip1 levels, the enzymatic activity of cyclin dependent kinases is decreased and the cell undergoes a specific cell cycle arrest."," ","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=1121","Michal Preminger, (617) 432-0920","Harvard University"

The patent covers improved methods of creating electrically-conductive materials by using electrostatic flocking to maximize the fiber density of the materials. In the methods of the invention, fibers such as carbon fibers are deposited directly onto a first electrically conductive surface, after which a second electrically conductive surface coated with an adhesive is placed over the first surface. A vacuum is then created in the space between the two surfaces, and the vacuum is filled with sulfur hexafluoride gas. An electric field is generated between the surfaces, causing the fibers to leave the first electrically conductive surface, accelerate through the electric field and sulfur hexafluoride, and become coupled to the adhesive on the second surface. The use of sulfur hexafluoride rather than air results in a significant increase in fiber density of the resulting fibrous structure. Materials created according to this method are advantageous in enabling enhanced heat transfer and have a number of potential uses, for example as a component of fuel cells for use in underwater applications, as well as in certain consumer electronic products.

"2005-0501","Licensable Technology","Method for introducing multiple wavelength laser excitations in fluorescence microscopy","Friedman, Lawrence; Chung, Johnson; Gelles, Jeff.","• The Situation: Fluorescence microscopes typically use dichroic mirrors to separate incident laser excitation from fluorescent sample emissions. However, dichroic mirrors appropriate for use with multiple excitation lasers introduce significant losses in the detected sample fluorescence.  Because of these losses, it is extremely difficult to perform single molecule experiments that involve more than two excitation lasers.

• Our Solution: Our newly designed fluorescence microscope separates the excitation and emission paths by employing small broadband mirrors in place of the wavelength-specific dichroic mirror. This enables single molecule fluorescence microscopy using multiple dye colors and improved signal-to-noise ratios.

Background:
Fluorescence microscopes typically use a wavelength sensitive dichroic mirror to separate the incident laser excitation from the low light imaging path. However, to detect multiple fluorescence dyes simultaneously, a dichroic optical setup becomes unacceptable due to the significant loss of fluorescence signals as the emissions pass through the dichroic mirror—a direct consequence of compromises in designing an optical filter that can separate multiple wavelengths. To circumvent this problem, we employ broadband mirrors to separate the illumination (excitation) light path from the detection (emission) light path in our new microscope setup. This permits us to employ any visible wavelength laser excitation and in addition results in very low background fluorescence compatible with single dye detection.

Application:
Multi-color single-molecule fluorescence microscopy.

Advantages:
• Low background fluorescence and high signal detection sensitivity.
• Broadband mirror works with all visible wavelengths, eliminating the need to switch dichroic filters in order to work with different color dyes.
• The technology allows simultaneous imaging of multiple fluorescence dyes.
• A TIRFM microscope incorporated with this technology has been built and successfully used in multi-color single-molecule fluorescence experiments.

Technology:
In the existing microscope, two broadband mirrors are used to direct laser excitation beams into and out of the objective lens, thereby separating the excitation light from the fluorescence emissions. With this novel design, autofluorescence from the objective lens is significantly reduced, thus improving the signal-to-noise level and resulting in high fluorescence detection sensitivity.

Examples of tissues that can be controlled include adipose tissue, intestinal polyps, muscle (including cardiac) tissue, and endometrial tissue. The response of these tissues to the angiogenesis inhibitors is dose-dependent, reversible, and common to a variety of different angiogenesis inhibitors (examples use TNP-470, angiostatin, and endostatin), based on studies in animal models of obesity, intestinal polyps, cardiac hypertrophy, and endometriosis. Initial studies conducted in an adipose tissue model (genetically obese mice and normal control mice) showed that the growth and mass of adipose tissue is under the control of microvascular endothelium. Expansion of adipose tissue was associated with endothelial cell proliferation. Inhibition of angiogenesis led to reduction in adipose tissue mass. Weight gain in animals receiving angiogenesis inhibitors was significantly restricted, in spite of increases in appetite sufficient to cause weight gain in paired-fed mice. Discontinuation of the inhibitor resulted in rapid expasion of the adipose tissue. The effect was dose-dependent, repeatedly reversible, and occurred in response to all of the inhibitors tested. Significant inhibition was also observed in both the intestinal polyp and cardiac hypertrophy animal models, using dosages of two-thirds or less than the dosages used to treat tumors. Preliminary results in an endometriosis model also show a clear trend towards decreased development of endometriosis in animals treated with angiogenesis inhibitors at a dosage of one-third the dosage used to treat tumors. No effect on normal tissue that was not proliferating, other than adipose tissue, was observed."," ","http://www.ipvisioninc.com/findurl.php?uid=mitDossier:7760","Lauren Foster","Massachusetts Institute of Technology"

The use of cultured human hepatocytes in the development of pharmaceuticals is quickly becoming a standard model for predicting a compound?s effects on enzymatic metabolism in the liver. It is currently estimated that more than $50MM is spent annually  on the purchase of primary cells for drug testing.

An emerging problem facing the cell supply industry is the growing scarcity of available source tissue and the quality and consistency of the cells obtained from those sources.

Inventors at the Massachusetts General Hospital, the Shriner?s Burns Hospital-Boston, and Massachusett?s Institute of Technology have developed methods and devices that will improve the viability of source tissue and provides for the harvesting of larger quantities of viable, primary hepatocytes from both healthy and ischemic sources. 

Preliminary studies indicate that a ten-fold increase in viable cells can be obtained from a normally non-viable, ischemic liver, and the cells were able to perform hepatic functions comparable to healthy livers, albeit slightly lower.

- Provides the ability to obtain cells from previously unusable sources
- Increases the quantity of harvested cells

In this manner, all fine features may be generated using the exact same density of intensity patterns, and therefore, maximum consistency between features is established without the need for optical proximity correction. The secondary exposures are substantially independent from the initial dense-feature exposure in that the exposure of one set of features and the subsequent exposure of another set of features result in separate independent resist or masking layer reactions, thus minimizing corner rounding, line end shortening and other related spatial frequency effects and unwanted exposure memory effects."," ","http://www.ipvisioninc.com/findurl.php?uid=mitDossier:8778L","Ben Palleiko","Massachusetts Institute of Technology"

By binding antigens and presenting the antigens to T cells, the MHC class II molecules are involved in triggering an immune response.  Thus, the level of expression of the MHC class II molecules affects the induction of an immune response.  Several autoimmune diseases are associated with expression of particular alleles of the MHC class II genes.

"JDP-044","Licensable Technology","Method of Making Pancreatic Islet Cells","Susan Bonner-Weir, Ph.D. et al.","A major, very promising avenue of investigation for treatment of diabetes is that of islet cell transplantation. A variety of strategies are under investigation for the introduction into diabetic patients of functioning pancreatic islet cells, which can produce insulin and overcome the diabetic phenotype. Although some results have been encouraging, there have been no long-term successes with islet transplantation. Problems encountered to date include the need for patients to take immunosuppressive drugs, or problems associated with use of animal tissue or insufficient supply of human islet cells from cadavers. Other avenues involving human embryonic stem cells, while intriguing, may be hindered by recent government policies restricting some forms of stem cell research. The present invention overcomes these hurdles through the discovery that certain cell types from the mature pancreas can be induced to de-differentiate, so as to serve as precursor cells for the ultimate redifferentiation into islet, exocrine, or mature duct cells. This invention leads to a potential source of islet cells for transplantation that is not dependent upon animals, or human embryonic stem cells. The invention comprises an improved method for treatment of diabetes using islet cell transplantation. Mature pancreatic cells are induced to de-differentiate according to the invention, and are then driven to create functioning islet cells, which can be transplanted into patients to treat or cure diabetes."," Therapeutics - Methods","http://www.joslinresearch.org/inventions","David J.

"461","Licensable Technology","Method of Predicting the Risk of Prostate Cancer Morbidity and Mortality","Kantoff, P","Prostate cancer is the most common malignant tumors and the second most common cause of cancer death in American males.  Interestingly, the androgen receptor gene contains a highly polymorphic CAG microsatellite in exon 1, resulting in a variable length glutamine repeat.  While the androgen receptor gene has been speculated to possess some relationship with prostate cancer, the nature of that relationship is unknown and the subject of speculation.

Researchers at the Dana-Farber have discovered that the number of CAG repeats in the androgen receptor determines the aggressiveness of prostate cancer and the likelihood that a patient of at least about 60 years of age will die of the disease.  For total prostate cancer, a slight inverse association between androgen receptor CAG repeat length and risk of disease was observed, but was not statistically significant.  However, CAG repeat length was inversely associated with cancers characterized as ?aggressive.?  Risk of advanced, aggressive, or fatal disease was particularly strongly related to CAG length among older men.

Applications/Advantages: The results also provide evidence that the variability in the androgen receptor CAG microsatellite influences the risk of developing ""aggressive"" prostate cancer. As a result, a method of predicting the onset of aggressive prostate cancer and the risk of mortality from the prostate cancer is available. The present invention additionally relates to the discovery that the length of the TA repeat polymorphism in the 5-alpha reductase gene is directly related with risk of aggressive disease."," Diagnostics/Biomarkers","http://www.dfci.harvard.edu/res/technology/available.asp?case_number=461&keywords=&category_id=5&category_name=Diagnostics","Ojas Mehta, Phone (617) 632-5807, Fax (617) 632-4012, Email Ojas_Mehta@dfci.harvard.edu","Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"

The oligos are synthesized with one portion of the first stem of the hairpin, followed by a first loop sequence, the complete second stem, a second loop sequence, and finished with the remaining portion of the first stem of the hairpin. The two portions of the first stem anneal to the second stem, juxtaposing the 5' end close to the 3' end of the oligo. The methods described herein selected for hairpins with perfectly base-paired stems. After annealing, a ligase is added to the annealed oligos and the base-paired hairpins are preferentially annealed, and ligated, creating closed circular oligos. The now circularized hairpins served as templates for rolling circle amplification using a polymerase with high processivity. One or more primers complementary to the two strands of the amplified double stranded circular hairpins initiate the rolling circle amplification in the presence of a polymerase. Using primers (e.g., a sense and antisense primer), the rolling circle amplification yields double stranded hairpin sequences.

A time varying voltage waveform having first and second voltage levels is applied through the etchant to the p-n junction. The first voltage level causes a zero forward bias across the p-n junction and the second voltage level causes a reverse bias across the p-n junction. The p-type region is removed by the chemical etchant down to the n-type region. This essentially removes the p-n junction in the area where the p-type region is etched away and resulting current through the n-type region causes a passivating layer to form on the surface of the n-type region which stops further etching."," ","http://www.ipvisioninc.com/findurl.php?uid=mitDossier:5220","Ben Palleiko","Massachusetts Institute of Technology"

Investigators at Children's Hospital, Beth Israel Hospital, and Harvard Medical School in Boston have shown that a certain pharmaceutical compound and its analogs inhibit salt and water secretion from intestinal cells in vitro. The cell model employed by the investigators reproduces all of the regulatory and transport pathways known to be responsible for fluid secretion in the intestine and is considered the ''gold standard'' for studies of intestinal fluid secretion. The experiments showed that the drug acts to inhibit the transport and signalling pathways that are fundamental to the secretion  process. The findings predict that the compound will be effective as a treatment for any secretory diarrhea.||

In one aspect, the invention provides a method and apparatus for monitoring cardiac output (CO) from a single blood pressure signal measurement obtained at any site in the systemic or pulmonary arterial tree or from any related measurement including, for example, fingertip photoplethysmography. According to the method the time constant of the arterial tree, defined to be the product of the total peripheral resistance (TPR) and the nearly constant arterial compliance, is determined by analyzing the long time scale variations (greater than a single cardiac cycle) in any of these blood pressure signals. Then, according to Ohm's law, a value proportional to CO may be determined from the ratio of the blood pressure signal to the estimated time constant. The proportional CO values derived from this method may be calibrated to absolute CO, if desired, with a single, absolute measure of CO (e.g., thermodilution).

"JDP-076","Licensable Technology","Methods and Compositions for Preventing Obesity and Related Disorders","Ronald Kahn, M.D. et al.","Type II diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance in several cell types, and although the molecular basis for this resistance is known for some tissue types, it has not previously been known for all. In some cell types, defects in the insulin receptor signaling pathway can result in insulin resistance, but this is not the case for all tissues. This invention is based on investigations of the effects of disruptions in insulin signaling in a tissue type where this was not previously known. The inventors have discovered that reduction of insulin receptor signaling (e.g., by disrupting or knocking out the insulin receptor itself) in this tissue type causes a decrease in fat mass and whole body triglyceride stores, loss of the normal relationship between plasma leptin and body weight, protection against obesity, and, at least in an animal model, increased life span. This discovery leads to several potential strategies for therapeutic intervention. The invention includes methods of treating or preventing weight gain or obesity, methods of treating obesity-related disorders such as diabetes, and methods of treating insulin resistant states such as polycystic ovarian disease and hypertension. Such methods feature the specific disruption of insulin receptor signaling activity in the targeted tissue type, but not in other tissues. Among ways this can be accomplished is the use of a targeting reagent to direct the therapeutic agent to this tissue type. Alternatively, the invention can be used to increase appetite or weight gain, for example, to treat anorexia. In addition, the invention can be used in food animals to increase or decrease the amounts of fat found in such animals."," Therapeutics - Methods","http://www.joslinresearch.org/inventions","David J.

"11587","Licensable Technology","Methods and Compositions Relating to Self-Assembling Amphiphiles as Drug Delivery Devices","Karp, Jeffrey M.; Vemula, Praveen K.; Cruikshank, Greg ; John, George","Technology:
The technology is a method to increase the yield of drugs delivered via an amphiphilic gel to diseased or damaged tissue.  Gels are appealing for biological applications because of their high water content and biocompatibility, and significant progress has been made in designing, synthesizing and using these materials for several biomedical applications including drug delivery.  However, most of the current drug delivery systems are derived from polymeric hydrogels as concerns regarding the possible toxicity of in situ fragments resulting from bond degradation remains a significant hurdle.  Through a simple one-step method, which could be scaled up in a production facility, the technology selectively forms an amphiphilic gel to encapsulate 1 or 2 drugs within the single-structure system without the toxicity concerns of polymeric hydrogel systems because upon enzyme-triggered degradation, the single-structure system degrades into pure drug and a single non-toxic fatty acid.  Also, this technology avoids the undesired burst release of drugs that is often associated with current polymer-based drug delivery systems.  The technology has been reduced to practice in vitro with in vivo work in progress. 

Applications:
The product application arising from this technology would be a method for manufacturing amphiphilic gel systems to more efficiently deliver drugs to diseased or damaged tissue.  The key here is optimization of the enzyme trigger to degrade the single-structure system as different enzymes are likely present in disease conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and glioblastoma.

Advantages:
- On-demand drug release for applications such as arthritis and chemotherapy; 
- Gel-based drug dispenser has greater drug efficacy as compared to polymer-encapsulated drugs; and
- Sustained levels of drug delivery."," Drug Delivery","http://www.partners.org/techtransfer/availabletechnologies/default.asp","Ulysses Sallum, usallum@partners.org, 617-954-9535","Brigham and Women's Hospital"
"3378","Licensable Technology","Methods and compounds for the treatments of spinal muscular atrophy and ALS","Rubin, Lee L.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is the leading genetic cause of death in infants. This neurodegenerative disease results from diminished levels of the protein Survival of Motor Neuron (SMN) in motor neurons and other cell types, such as muscle. Data derived from SMA patients and from SMA mouse models suggest that therapeutics that elevate Survival of Motor Neuron (SMN) levels will be effective in treating this disease. Current treatment for SMA consists of prevention and management of the secondary effect of chronic motor unit loss. No high-throughput screen has been performed to identify drug compounds that modulate SMN levels in cells. Therefore, there is an unmet need in compounds and methods for direct treatments of SMA and other neurodegenerative disorders that are affected by SMN levels.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Scientists in the Rubin laboratory have carried out an image-based screen of pharmacologically active small molecules to find compounds that increase SMN in patient fibroblasts. They have discovered more than 150 active compounds that fell into several classes that were able to increase cellular SMN. Among the most important was the RTK–PI3K–AKT–GSK-3 signaling cascade. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) is a particularly key druggable intracellular target, and inhibitors of GSK-3 not only increase SMN but rescue motor neuron death. We believe that this is the first time that an SMA screen has produced compounds that have such a striking effect on a major component of the disease. Future work will be directed at testing GSK-3 inhibitors and other modulators of intracellular signaling in mouse models of SMA."," Drug Discovery Tools  |   Therapeutics - Drugs  |   Drug Discovery Tools","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3378","Vivian Berlin, (617) 496-0474","Harvard University"

"UMD 10-04","Licensable Technology","Methods and systems for determining fish catches","Glenn Chamberlain et al.","Federal fishery regulations that establish quotas for certain fish species require fishing vessels to record and store an increasing percentage of their fishing trips. Currently, a fishing vessel could use a CatchMeter, which quickly identifies and assigns species to fish as they pass along a conveyer belt, but this system is only practical for processing plants and large research vessels. The alternative would be manual counting by a human observer.  UMass Dartmouth researchers have developed a more accurate method for fishermen to estimate the length and weight from piles of fish by using an technique (photogrammetry) used successfully in other applications.  This method can provide more real-time analyzable data at sea, eliminate the need for an expensive on-board human monitor and minimize needless waste from fish dumped overboard.
The system uses two digital still Single Lens Reflex cameras mounted in waterproof housings. The SLR cameras’ better resolution improves photogrammetric measurement precision compared to many digital still cameras and video cameras, and images taken by SLR cameras require less storage space and less time to analyze than video images. Among the potential benefits of the invention are dramatic improvements in accuracy in measuring catch composition, weight and volume in real-time, ability to be adapted to most fishing boats, applicability to many different species of fish, and significant potential cost savings compared with manual monitoring systems and other automated systems.

"MCL 1760.0","Licensable Technology","Methods and Systems for Drug Screening and Computational Modeling","Peter Siekmeier, M.D., et al.","The invention provides a valuable adjunct to high-throughput screening (HTS) and other tools of modern drug discovery for neuropsychiatric disorders. Specifically, it comprises a method for computer modeling in a computational network of the effects that different chemical compounds or biological factors might have on specific disorders of the brain, as a means of selecting desired chemicals for further research. This can be useful particularly for disorders where there is no good animal model: it can help to identify candidate molecules in conjunction with further chemical analysis, rational drug design, in silico computer-aided drug design, or high-throughput screening. For example, for those diseases or disorders for which a neuronal model has been or can be constructed, one can incorporate into the system computer models of how certain drugs or types of drugs interact with neurons at the cellular level. The neuronal network model then allows one to translate the effects of the drug on a single neuron to the effects it might have on an entire system.
The operation of this model is dependent upon the availability of information, suitable for inclusion in computer models, on the interaction of specific drugs with neurons. Such experimentally-derived data are available for some drug categories today, but it is expected that the availability of such data will continually increase in coming years. Similarly, neuronal models have been constructed for some brain disorders, and others will become available in the future. We anticipate that the concepts developed to date will support a broad Inventions for License position that will cover current and future embodiments of this powerful concept.
     Potential Commercial Uses: 
Rapid screening of chemical compounds in silico, particularly for those psychiatric and neurological disorders where no suitable animal models exist.
Ability to assess drug candidates based on their neurophysiologic effects rather than on biochemical properties alone. In particular, the cellular effects of a candidate medication can be incorporated into the screen, even if its full constellation of molecular targets is not yet understood.

Applications: The diagnostic aspect allows for accurate and quantitative determination of a biomarker found in blood serum from patients suffering from immune disease. The biomarker also provides a specific target for therapeutic intervention of immune related disorders.

Advantages:
-	Less invasive means of patient sample collection required for diagnosis.
-	Single disease-related-cell sensitivity.
-	Single quantifiable measurement used for diagnosis.
-	Highly specific targeting of disease-related cells instead of general immune-cell population knockdown.

"6022","Licensable Technology","Methods for epi-retinal implantation","Rizzo, Joseph  F","A method for epi-retinal implantation of an object into a subject is disclosed. The method includes rendering the normally transparent cortical vitreous visible and separating at least a portion of a cortical vitreous of the subject away from an adherent retinal surface to form an epi-retinal space between the retina and the separated cortical vitreous material. An object to be implanted may be introduced into the epi-retinal space and the object engaged with a surface of the retina. In preferred embodiments, the object may then be adhered to the surface of the retina. A method for implantation of a neural contact structure for contact with neural tissue, for example, neural tissue of the retina within which are ganglion cells to be electrically stimulated is also described. The contact structure comprises a first portion for attachment to a first bodily location, such as the inner surface of the retina, and a second portion interconnected with the first portion via an interconnection and being held in contact with the neural tissue. The interconnection exhibits a weak restoring force which in conjunction with the geometry of said second portion provides a preselected desired pressure of contact against the neural tissue. As adapted for the retina, the interconnection exhibits a weak restoring force developed in response to curvature of the interconnection along the inner radius of the retina."," ","http://www.ipvisioninc.com/findurl.php?uid=mitDossier:6022","Andrea Schievella","Massachusetts Institute of Technology"

The matrix material is formed into a unitary body and solidified. The cores are pulled out, leaving open channels where they had been. Some core and matrix combinations will permit the cores to be pulled out. Others require a core release coating to be applied to the cores. The cores can be metal or ceramic or polymer, and the matrix can be metal or ceramic or polymer. The cores can be solid, or hollow. Rather than pulling the cores out, if they are polymer, they can be burned out. The matrix can be formed by liquid state, solid state, or hybrid liquid/solid state techniques. A related technique uses hollow cores, which are not pulled out, but which remain in the body after unification. For such tube-walled articles, the matrix can be formed similarly. Rather than insuring core release, core retention is required. Such may occur due to the nature of the materials, or a specific core retention coating may be provided. Articles made of such material include heat sinks for semiconductor devices, light-weight structural components, thermally activated actuators, etc. Very small channel diameters and very large length to opening aspect ratios can be achieved.

IKK-beta activation causes insulin resistance under conditions of obesity, high fat diet and lipid infusion. Aspirin (salicylate) inhibits the catalytic subunit of IKK-beta and this enhances signaling through signal transduction cascades arising from the insulin receptor. This can lead to reversal of insulin resistance. Heterozygous deletion of the IKK-beta gene reverses insulin resistance due to obesity, high fat diet and lipid infusion, which further validates the target. The invention provides novel methods for screening for drug candidates for treatment of disorders involving insulin resistance. The screening methods involve assaying for compounds capable of binding IKK-beta.

Dr. Rao's and colleagues identified novel catalytic activity for the family of TET proteins, namely TET1, TET2, and TET3. Their discoveries provide several novel methods, reagents, and kits for detecting sites of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) in biological samples and includes antibodies and chemical modification for covalent tagging of 5-hmC. Specifically, the methods include antibody-mediated detection of 5-hmC or a bisulfite modified version of 5-hmC, cytosine methylene sulfonate (CMS), as well as addition of glucose to 5-hmC followed by further chemical modifications that permit highly sensitive and specific detection and precipitation of 5-hmC.||
   
Rao and colleagues also found that members of the TET family of enzymes are highly expressed in ES cells and iPS cells, and that a gain in pluripotency is associated with induction of members of the TET family of enzymes and the presence of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, while a loss of pluripotency suppresses TET family enzyme expression and results in a loss of 5- hydroxymethylcytosine. Therefore, the TET family of enzymes provide a novel set of non-transcription factor targets that can be used to modulate and regulate the differentiation status of cells which may promote the reprogramming of somatic cells into pluripotent cells, and for modulating pluripotency and cellular differentiation status.||

"MCL 20165.0","Licensable Technology","Methods for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Parkinson's Disease","Ole Isacson, M.D. Ph.D., et al.","Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive motor system disorder affecting as many as one million Americans, that can arise from environmental and/or genetic factors.  Regardless of specific etiology, it has been found that dopaminergic neurons in the A9 region of the brain (substantia nigra pars compacta) are considerably more vulnerable than dopaminergic neurons in the immediately adjacent A10 region (ventral tegmental area). It is likely that different gene products expressed in the A10 neurons provide a neuroprotective effect. Based on extensive gene expression studies comparing A9 and A10 neurons, the inventors have discovered that elevated levels of the transcription factor Otx2 are neuroprotective of dopaminergic neurons. Otx2 is a homeodomain transcription factor, whose expression is restricted to the forebrain and midbrain in the nervous system during development and which plays an important role in proliferation and differentiation of midbrain dopaminergic progenitors during mitosis.Otx2 overexpression in A9 neurons of rodents caused increased expression of proteins known to be overexpressed in A10 neurons, and resulted in significant neuroprotection of the A9 neurons. 
     Potential Commercial Uses: This invention features methods for the treatment or prevention of PD by increasing the expression or activity of Otx2 (e.g. introducing Otx2 protein or nucleic acid into the A9 region of the brain).  By identifying a novel target for PD, this invention will lead to safer, more specific, and more powerful treatments for PD, which would be of great importance given the prevalence of this disease in our aging populations. Current therapy for PD, such as the use of the dopamine precursor L-DOPA to replace brain dopamine, has had only limited effectiveness.

"MCL 3088.0","Licensable Technology","Methods for Treatment of Mood Disorders","Bruce Cohen, M.D., Ph.D., Beth Murphy, M.D., Ph.D.","This invention offers a potentially powerful new approach to the treatment of mood disorders, that can be practiced with at least one known compound with a favorable human safety profile. Animal and human studies suggest that modulation of the kappa opioid receptor (KOR) can alter mood: direct activation of KOR causes depressogenic effects, while blockade of KOR has antidepressant-like effects.  Consistent with this, the effects of current antipsychotic drugs, which are potent antimanic agents, may be mediated in part,through an increase in the activity of dynorphinergic neurons, resulting in the release of dynorphin, the endogenous agonist at KOR. Based on the above evidence, the inventors have theorized that directly-acting kappa agonists might ameliorate the symptoms of mania. The inventors have found that an existing analgesic agent, known to be a partial KOR agonist, caused a statistically significant reduction in manic symptoms in a small open-label clinical study. Ten subjects, all diagnosed with bipolar mania, received two doses of this compound, two hours apart, and were assessed over a 6-hour period using the Mania Acute Change Scale (MACS). In the first hour after each dose, the average MACS score decreased 41-44%. Measured over the subsequent 3 days using a different rating scale, a statistically significant improvement in mood was also seen.
     Potential Commercial Uses: The invention comprises methods of treating mania, bipolar disorder, or mood disorders by administering a kappa receptor agonist or partial agonist. The invention can be practiced using one specific commercially-available drug with a known human safety profile. This compound exists as a racemic mixture, and using the pure enantiomer could lead to an improved therapeutic outcome with a novel chemical entity.

The invention is based on the discovery that a peptide neurotransmitter plays a role in the effector phase of arthitogenesis. This neuropeptide has previously been implicated as having a role in the regulation of inflammation, and the inventors have discovered that mice deficient in the neuropeptide do not develop arthritis in a well-studied model where the disease can be induced experimentally (the K/BxN system). The invention comprises methods of treating or preventing the development of rheumatoid arthritis by inhibiting this neuropeptide. Among preferred methods of inhibition are the use of inhibitory nucleic acids such as siRNA, inhibitory peptides, or an antibody or antigen binding fragment directed at the neuropeptide. This neuropeptide is a promising new target for investigation of new avenues of therapy for rheumatoid arthritis."," Therapeutics - Methods","http://www.joslinresearch.org/inventions","David J.

CD36 is an 88 kDa membrane protein expressed on the surface of a wide variety of cell types, including adipocytes, skeletal muscle cells, platelets, and endothelial cells. CD36 is a class B scavenger receptor recognizing a variety of ligands including long-chain fatty acids and modified LDL, which has also been recently implicated as a regulator of the metabolic pathways involved in insulin resistance. The invention features diagnostic methods to detect an individual’s susceptibility to developing cardiovascular disease. This is done by analysis of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the CD36 gene that correlate to the disease risk. Five specific SNPs were analyzed and found to correlate to free fatty acid (FFA) levels and to risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). At three of these loci, men homozygous for one allele had 30% higher FFA levels than did men homozygous for the other allele.

"JDP-089","Licensable Technology","Methods of Diagnosing Renal Disease","Andrzej  Krolewski, M.D., Ph.D.  et al.","Diabetic kidney disease, also known as diabetic nephropathy, will develop in 25-40% of individuals with Type 1 diabetes mellitus, often leading to early death. The development of diabetic nephropathy generally consists of progression from normoalbuminuria (normal Urinary Albumin Excretion, or UAE) through three successive clinical stages: microalbuminuria (MA), characterized by a small increase in UAE; overt proteinuria, characterized by abundant UAE and the beginnings of renal function loss; and end stage renal disease (ESRD), which requires renal replacement therapy and is coupled with high mortality. The invention is based on the inventors’ discovery that polymorphisms in one particular gene are correlated with decreased risk of the progression of proteinuria to ESRD and decreased risk of coronary artery disease. A total of 221 patients with Type I diabetes and overt proteinuria, 51 of which developed ESRD, were followed for an average of 6 years and genotyped at three sites in the target gene. Among patients lacking polymorphism #1, 27% progressed to ESRD, compared to only 8% for individuals having one copy of this polymorphism. Polymorphism #2 was present in 40% of individuals with normoabluminuria but only 23% of those with proteinuria or ESRD. A third polymorphism was present in 35% of individuals with normoabluminuria but only 23% of those with proteinuria or ESRD. Correlations were also found to the incidence of coronory artery disease. The invention features methods of evaluating a patient to determine predisposition to renal disease (e.g., end stage renal disease or diabetic nephropathy) by evaluating the specific polymorphisms of the invention, e.g., a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), at a specified locus. Such a diagnostic test would be valuable in that it would allow identification of patients at risk for ESRD far earlier than is now possible, perhaps making it feasible to screen a large proportion of individuals with Type 1 diabetes."," Diagnostics/Biomarkers","http://www.joslinresearch.org/inventions","David J.

The family of proteins are the sirtuins, Class III histone deacetylases (HDACs) which are known to play roles in gene silencing and DNA repair, and which also have been implicated in determination of lifespan in model organisms. The inventors have discovered that one member of the sirtuin family can promote adipogenesis when adenoviral constructs expressing the protein were introduced into mouse cells. In addition, a different member of the family was identified in gene expression studies to be down-regulated in mouse models of diabetes. Numerous other proteins were found in the gene expression studies to either be up-regulated or down-regulated in the diabetic animal models. These two sirtuin proteins are targets for drug development and therapeutic intervention against Type 2 diabetes, obesity and other disorders. The invention includes methods of treating obesity and related diseases by inhibiting or blocking the action of the first sirtuin protein, for example through the use of known HDAC inhibitors.

The current treatment for Type I diabetes consists of lifelong daily insulin injections; however, in addition to the obvious disadvantages of such a strategy, it is impossible to titrate insulin doses to fluctuating blood glucose levels as precisely as needed, which results in less-than-optimal glucose control.  The ideal treatment would be to restore functional beta cells to the pancreas.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Scientists in the Melton’s laboratory of Harvard University have succeeded in directly reprogramming fully differentiated exocrine cells into beta-cells in adult animals, using a combination of three transcription factors: Ngn3, Pdx1 and Mafa. The induced beta-cells are indistinguishable from endogenous islet beta-cells in morphology and ultrastructure. Also, molecular marker analysis reveals that most of the cells co-express genes essential for beta-cell endocrine function including glucose transporter 2 (Glut2), glucokinase (GCK), prohormone convertase (PC1/3), and the key beta-cell transcription factors NeuroD, Nkx2.2, and Nkx6.1. Importantly, these cells express C-peptide (part of proinsulin) and can synthesize and secrete insulin, reversing hyperglycemia. This direct reprogramming technology holds promise for converting one type of differentiated adult cell into another, and raises the possibility of generating patient-specific and therapeutically important cell types such as pancreatic beta-cells for regenerative medical uses in the future."," Drug Discovery Tools  |   Therapeutics - Methods  |   Drug Discovery Tools","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3312","Vivian Berlin, (617) 496-0474","Harvard University"

The technology can produce a dyeable polypropylene by using nanoclay that is surface modified with cationic surfactants. The nanoclay is evenly distributed within the polypropylene matrix and provides desired dye affinity in the polymer system. The nanoclays
are introduced to the polypropylene matrix in a melting or dissolving process with a combination of heat and/or organic solvent. This technology can easily be adapted to different processes, using mechanical blending, ultrasonication and/or screw mixing. This low cost process technology can be used to produce polypropylene fibers and fabrics with acid and disperse dyeability properties. These new dyeable polymer nanocomposites can be widely used for making fibers, fabrics, films, plates, sheets, and bulk materials such toys, utensils, appliances, furniture, and plastic tools as well as packaging materials.

"JDP-124","Licensable Technology","Methods of Generating Insulin-Producing Cells","Gordon Weir, M.D. et al.","A promising avenue of investigation for treatment of diabetes is that of islet cell transplantation. A variety of strategies are under investigation for the introduction into diabetic patients of functioning pancreatic islet cells, which can produce insulin and overcome the diabetic phenotype. Although some results have been encouraging, there have been no long-term successes with islet transplantation. Problems encountered to date include the need for patients to take immunosuppressive drugs, or problems associated with use of animal tissue or insufficient supply of human islet cells from cadavers. Other avenues involving human embryonic stem cells, while intriguing, may be hindered by recent government policies restricting some forms of stem cell research. The present invention overcomes these hurdles through the discovery that certain cell types from mature individuals can be induced to de-differentiate, so as to serve as precursor cells for the ultimate redifferentiation into mature, insulin-producing cells. This invention leads to a potential source of islet cells for transplantation that is not dependent upon animals or human embryonic stem cells. The invention comprises an improved method for treatment of diabetes using islet cell transplantation. Using a cell type that has not previously been investigated for this purpose, cells from mature individuals can be induced to de-differentiate, and can then be driven to differentiate into functioning islet cells, for transplantation into diabetic patients."," Therapeutics - Methods","http://www.joslinresearch.org/inventions","David J.

Researchers at the Dana-Farber have discovered that creatine compounds and hyperplastic inhibitory agents, such as chemotherapeutic agents, additively and synergistically combine to inhibit undesirable cell growth.

Applications/Advantages: The combination therapy can be advantageous over conventional chemotherapeutic approaches because the synergistic aspect allows the physician to administer less of the hyperplastic inhibitory agent resulting in fewer side effects in the patient being treated. In addition to in vivo therapeutic purposes, the invention can also be used ex vivo for purging bone marrow and in ex vivo screening assays for tissue or cells removed during surgery to determine whether the tissue or cells are cancerous or benign."," Therapeutics - Methods","http://www.dfci.harvard.edu/res/technology/available.asp?case_number=350&keywords=&category_id=1&category_name=Therapeutics","Ojas Mehta, Phone (617) 632-5807, Fax (617) 632-4012, Email Ojas_Mehta@dfci.harvard.edu","Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"

"JDP-075","Licensable Technology","Methods of Modulating Beta-Cell Growth and Function","Eleftheria Maratos-Flier, M.D.  et al.","The invention is based on the discovery that a naturally-occurring hormone, known to be involved in feeding behavior and certain neurological functions, can also modulate pancreatic endocrine function and/or growth. Specifically, overexpression of this hormone results in increased plasma insulin concentration and increased pancreatic islet size. It is believed that this hormone acts through its own receptor, so that the hormone, its receptor, and other components of its signaling pathway can serve as targets for the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes and other insulin-related disorders. The invention features several ways to treat insulin-related disorders, based on this newly discovered role for the hormone. For example, the invention includes methods of modulating pancreatic function (e.g., insulin secretion) or growth (beta-cell size and growth) by modulating the hormone’s signaling pathway. In general, up-regulating the signaling pathway will result in increased pancreatic function, but the invention can also be used to suppress pancreatic function. In addition, the invention provides a means of culturing or propagating islet cells or beta-cells, by growing said cells in the presence of the hormone or in combination with another agent that stimulates the signaling pathway. Other uses, including diagnosis of susceptibility for diabetes, and drug screening, are also possible."," Therapeutics - Methods","http://www.joslinresearch.org/inventions","David J.

Thus, interfering with activity of this growth factor, or its interaction with the receptor, might treat hypertension or its complications. It was also found that a particular isoform of a protein kinase mediates the increased expression of the growth factor and its receptor, so that inhibition of the kinase activity might also act against hypertension or its complications. The invention therefore provides novel potential strategies for the treatment of the complications of hypertension or other vascular disorders, comprising administration of agents that can interfere with the interaction of the growth factor and its receptor, or the activity of the kinase isoform in triggering enhanced gene expression of the growth factor and/or receptor.

"JDP-058","Licensable Technology","Methods of Modulating Fibrosis","George Liang King, M.D.","The invention features a novel approach to the modulation of the cellular pathways leading to fibrosis and extracellular matrix deposition. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is known to be a potent activator of fibrosis, angiogenesis and extracellular matrix production. The invention is based on the finding that a different growth factor regulates CTGF activity through a particular signal transduction pathway. Decreasing the activity of this other growth factor, or of key intermediates in the signal transduction pathway, leads to decreased CTGF activity and decreased fibrosis or decreased angiogenesis. Conversely, fibrosis and angiogenesis can be increased, where desired, by use of agents that increase the activity of the growth factor or pathway intermediates. The invention therefore provides novel potential strategies for the modulation of fibrosis or angiogenesis, using agents that modulate the various factors that affect CTGF activity through the newly-identified pathway. Inhibitors of this pathway can be used to inhibit fibrosis, for example in disorders like scleroderma, pulmonary fibrosis or scarring. Activators of the pathway may be used to promote fibrosis, for example in the case of wound healing. The pathway may also be modulated to modulate angiogenesis, perhaps as a cancer treatment. Finally, the invention provides new screening methods to identify drug candidates for any of these types of diseases."," Therapeutics - Methods  |   Therapeutics - Drugs","http://www.joslinresearch.org/inventions","David J.

"JDP-091","Licensable Technology","Methods of Treating Diabetes","Diane Mathis, Ph.D. and Christophe Benoist, Ph.D. et al.","Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease characterized by immune system attack on the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreatic islets, resulting in the loss of glucose homeostasis and ultimately hyperglycemia. T1D is often preceded by the development of insulitis, in which a leukocytic infiltrate dominated by autoreactive T cells invades the islets. In humans, insulitis does not always progress to diabetes, with some infiltrates being more aggressive than others, and this progression appears to be a regulated process. Understanding this process might lead to possible therapeutic approaches as well as ways to predict or detect which patients having insulitis are likely to progress to T1D. The invention is based on the inventors’ discovery that a certain population of immune cells is over-represented in the aggressive infiltrates that ultimately progress to full-blown T1D, and that depleting these cells leads to a decrease in the incidence of T1D. Therefore, this population of cells might be targeted in therapeutic applications to prevent the development of T1D in patients. The invention features methods of treating or preventing the onset of T1D, by administering agents that can reduce the numbers of this specific immune cell population in the pancreatic infiltrate. Several agents to accomplish this are known and disclosed.

"JDP-071","Licensable Technology","Methods of Treating Obesity","Martin Myers, M.D., Ph.D.","The hormone leptin regulates food intake, metabolic rate and endocrine function. Disruption of leptin or its receptor molecule abolishes normal regulatory mechanisms, leading to obesity and endocrine dysfunction. The leptin receptor activates certain signal transduction pathways that mediate its normal roles in the cell. The inventor has discovered that certain signaling pathways of the leptin receptor play a role in control of body weight, while distinct pathways control other functions such as fertility. These pathways can be distinguished in transgenic mice in which an isoform of the receptor is mutated to lack one key amino acid, the phosphorylation of which triggers the weight control pathways. Mice mutated at this locus become obese without losing other functions such as fertility. The invention therefore comprises methods of modulating appetite or weight gain, involving the manipulation of this specific leptin receptor signaling pathway. Up-regulating the pathway results in decreased appetite and weight loss (for treatment or control of obesity), while inhibiting the pathway can result in increased appetite (e.g., to treat individuals with eating disorders). In addition to these possible therapeutic approaches, the invention can be used in screening and discovery of potential weight control agents. Further, transgenic animals having the desired mutation in the receptor isoform can be used as a model for obesity, in which fertility and other important bodily functions are not disrupted."," Therapeutics - Methods","http://www.joslinresearch.org/inventions","David J.

"JDP-090","Licensable Technology","Methods of Treating or Preventing Autoimmune Conditions","Diane Mathis, Ph.D. et al.","The innate immune system is the first line of host defense against pathogens. Innate immune cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, are first activated and subsequently trigger the generation of optimal adaptive immune responses. Although these cells lack the highly specific antigen receptors of B cells and T cells, they can detect pathogens by recognizing conserved motifs present in pathogen-associated components and, in turn, activate the appropriate defense pathway. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are one class of receptors that recognize pathogen-associated components. To date, ten TLRs have been discovered, each of which recognizes different ligands. TLR-9 recognizes unmethylated CpG dinucleotide motifs, which are prevalent in bacterial and viral DNAs, but are suppressed and methylated in vertebrate genomes. The immune system responds to the various CpG motifs by activating potent Th1-like immune responses. The invention is based on the surprising finding that modulation of TLR-9 level or activity affects the onset and progression of autoimmune conditions. Specifically, the inventors have shown that administration of nucleic acids containing unmethylated CpG motifs prevents the onset of arthritis and significantly reduces the severity of arthritis in a well-characterized animal model. CpG can also halt the progression of arthritis already in progress. These results are surprising and unexpected because the intraarticular administration of CpG oligos had previously been shown to induce arthritis in various mouse models (Deng et al., (1999) Nature Medicine 5: 702), and because other reports showed that stimulation of the TLR-4 receptor enhances arthritis (Choe etal., (2003) J.Exp. Med. 197: 537-542). The invention comprises compositions and methods for treating, reducing or preventing autoimmune conditions, particularly including arthritis. Specifically, compositions which include unmethylated CpG motifs, or other agents that are capable of activating the TLR-mediated immune response, can be used to treat, prevent or reduce the severity of autoimmune conditions."," Therapeutics - Drugs","http://www.joslinresearch.org/inventions","David J.

"MCL 3268.0","Licensable Technology","Methods of Treating Pathological Gambling and other Compulsive Disorders","Igor Elman, M.D.","Impulse Control Disorders (ICDs) are a sub-group of mental/psychiatric disorders which are characterized by harmful behaviors acted out in response to seemingly irresistible impulses.  The essential feature characterizing ICDs is the failure to resist an impulse, drive, or temptation to perform an act that is known to be harmful to the actor or others. Examples of ICDs include pathological gambling, binge eating disorders, kleptomania, pyromania, tricholtillomania, compulsive shopping/buying/spending, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and substance use/abuse disorders. Cumulatively, ICDs affect a large percentage of the population, and many of them entail significant costs to society: for example, it has been estimated that the annual cost to society of pathological gambling is $54 billion. At present, there are few safe and effective treatments for ICDs. Many of the available treatments are ineffective, expensive, and/or have serious deleterious effects that limit the dose or duration of therapy.  Furthermore, many available pharmacological treatments are, themselves, prone to addiction and abuse.   
     Potential Commercial Uses: The invention is based on the growing understanding of the neuronal pathways that underlie impulse control disorders, and the cross-sensitization that occurs between these pathways. The invention therefore features methods for treating ICDs using centrally-acting compounds (i.e. capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier) that can inhibit a specific neurotransmission pathway. A number of existing pharmaceutical compounds are known to be active against this pathway, and such compounds can be used in the method. The invention therefore provides a potentially safe, effective means of treating pathological gambling and other ICDs for which no viable therapies currently exist.

We may discover new molecular mechanisms for processes spanning normal development to genetic disease by identifying the relevant mRNAs.  Accordingly, this invention provides methods for isolating individual mRNAs.  The method relies upon two oligodeoxynucleotide primers; one is short with an arbitrary sequence, and the other is capable of hybridizing to the region near the mRNA polyA tail.  The latter primer is used for reverse transcription of the mRNA, and the resultant cDNA is amplified with a polymerase using both oligodeoxynucleotides as a primer set.  A few hundred cDNAs may now be isolated and identified using gel electrophoresis. 

Applications/Advantages: Using this method with different pairs of alterable primers, virtually any of the mRNAs from a given cell type or stage of the cell cycle (including very low abundance mRNAs) can be identified and isolated.  A comparison of the mRNAs from closely related cells (which for example may be at different stages of the cell cycle) can show the mRNAs that are constitutively versus differentially expressed.  By simple visual inspection, one may use this method to identify the genes that are altered in their frequency of expression."," Research Reagents","http://www.dfci.harvard.edu/res/technology/available.asp?case_number=234&keywords=&category_id=3&category_name=Research+Reagents","Nancy Grodin, Phone (617) 632-5516, Fax (617) 632-4012, Email Nancy_Grodin@dfci.harvard.edu","Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"

Current methods to distinguish among these cells rely upon DNA polymorphisms unique to donor and recipient.  This invention provides methods for both detecting and identifying allelic variants in cell lineage-specific mRNA.  While genomic DNA-based methods yield information about all nucleated cells, this RNA-based method is restricted to the assessment of expressed genes unique to a specific cell lineage.  The method first entails reverse-transcribing cDNA from the mRNA.  One may then either amplify the cDNA to detect lineage-specific cells, or amplify an allelic variant from the cDNA to identify lineage-specific allelic variants.  

Applications/Advantages: This invention holds potential for conditions that may be alleviated by transplanting progenitor or genetically-engineered cells.  For example, if a subject has received a progenitor cell transfer for the treatment of sickle cell syndrome, one may use this technology to determine if the level of lineage-specific RNA is adequate to alleviate disease symptoms and promote erythropoiesis; if not, a second transfer of stem cells or an infusion of donor lymphocytes may be indicated.

(Harvard); Weitz, David (Harvard)","• The Situation: Protein crystallization is a nonequillibrium process requiring one set of conditions for crystal nucleation and another set for crystal growth. Current methods for optimizing protein crystallization conditions are laborious and are not conducive to automation or high throughput screening.

• Our Solution: We developed a microfluidic device, the Phase Chip, which offers dynamic and precise control over the concentration of solvent and solute, allowing optimization of protein crystallization conditions by high-throughput screening methods.

Background:
Sixty percent of drugs target an important class of membrane proteins know as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), representing $47 billion in annual sales. However, due to vast difficulties in obtaining high quality and stable protein crystals for X-ray crystallography, only a few of membrane protein structures have been solved. An efficient and automated method for optimizing protein crystallization conditions will be invaluable for developing specific drug targets. A microfluidic chip, which consists of very small fluid channels and small reaction chambers at a high density (1000 microwells per square inch), can be implemented in the protein crystallization optimization process. Microfluidic systems offer many advantages over conventional crystallization techniques and allow automated screening of many sample conditions simultaneously, resulting in faster, cheaper, and reproducible analyses. 

Applications:
• Phase Chip is designed for the optimization of protein crystallization conditions.
• To determine phase diagrams of a wide variety of other multicomponent fluids, such as surfactants, liquid crystals,  polymer solutions, drug polymorphs. 

Advantages:
• Lab-on-a-chip technology allowing high-throughput screening and automation.
• Uses 1,000 times less protein than standard crystallography.
• Phase Chip can store hundreds of sub-nanoliter drops in individual wells and permits hundreds of crystallization conditions to be tested per chip.
• Decouples crystal nucleation and growth in a precisely controlled and reversible way, allowing independent optimization of the two processes to produce high quality and stable crystals for X-ray crystallography.
• Prototype has been built and tested successfully.

Technology:
The Phase Chip is a microfluidic device that allows high throughput screening of protein crystallization conditions. The device is manufactured using soft-lithography, and contains microwells for the storage of microdrops of protein-solvent mixtures. The bottom of a microwell is a semi-permeable membrane separating the storage cell from a reservoir. The water in the microdrop and in the reservoir are in chemical equilibrium via the membrane. By varying the chemical potential of the reservoir, the concentration of solutes in the microdrop can be precisely manipulated and in a reversible way. Because crystallization is a nonequilibrium process it is necessary to screen the duration and length of quenches of the metastable solution into deep supersaturation. The Phase Chip is designed to systematically screen the two parameters of quench time and depth and exploits the benefits of microfluidics, such as low volume, high throughput and ease of automation, to produce faster and less costly analyses. Using the Phase Chip, we can control the nucleation and crystal growing processes independently, allowing optimal conditions for membrane protein crystallization.

This is a rapid microfluidic chip platform. This device has been demonstrated to detect HIV particles in blood with sensitivity equal to that of PCR based strategies, (50 copies/ml). There are two components in this device system: a disposable microfluidic chip and a small dedicated reader that measures a shift in incident light wavelength created by respective viral particles.  Nano-scale surface chemistry enables high-precision viral particle counting and could also be adapted to detect leukocytes, bacteria, and circulating cancer cells.  

Populations that stand to benefit from the commercialization of this technology include newborns infected with HIV via mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) and through adaptation patients in rural settings suffering from blood-borne infections and diseases of many kinds.  It is estimated that over 450,000 infants are infected through MTCT annually. To reduce morbidity and improve quality of life for persons living with HIV/AIDS, the World Health Organization (WHO) is rapidly expanding access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in developing countries accounting for over 67% of HIV-1 infections. However, the expansion is significantly restricted by the lack of cost-effective POC viral load assays that can effectively reach patients living in rural, isolated settings.

Typically such phenotypic changes are monitored through the use of fluorescent indicators and/or changes in cell morphology. To enable substances to be screened in a high-throughput manner, current screening technologies rely on one either automated digital fluorescent microscopy and/or flow cytometry. Both of these methods have their pros and cons: Microscopy is highly sensitive – allowing detection of single fluorescent molecules – and provides superior information in terms of cell morphology and size, as well as protein localization and abundance. In contrast, flow cytometry enables much higher throughput screening, with analysis and sorting of >500,000 cells per minute. An ideal screening technology would therefore combine the best features of both these methods.As a new platform for cell-based, high-throughput screening (HTS) it can be used in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries for the identification of lead drugs, perform toxicity tests, screen for antibiotics effects, and carry out functional genomics screens. To date, the platform has been shown to work well for bacterial cells, and yeast.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Dr. Paulsson and colleagues have developed a microfluidic platform that enables high throughput microscopy-based screening. The platform – named MACS for microfluidics-assisted cell screening - utilizes a soft flexible polymer to trap cells flowing through a channel, once trapped; the cells are imaged and then released. By repeating this process over and over again, Paulsson and his colleagues are able to image thousands of cells each minute, detecting rare events and mutations, which is many more than conventional microscopy typically allows. So far, imaging ability of the machine was tested on both prokaryotes and eukaryotic cells. This device, retaining full benefits of  classic microscopy, enables for the first time, the localization of single molecules in cells in combination with high-throughput screening, while most other FACS/imaging methods struggle to even determine the rough size and shape of cells. It also allows for analysis of growth rates via an upstream growth chamber where the culture turbidity can be measured. Some other benefits include: minimal lag time between sample preparation and imaging [thanks to automation], since the device is simply mounted on top of the microscope, it can keep up with improvements in microscopy. Most importantly, the platform is highy flexible and costs a tiny fraction of other devices."," Instrumentation  |   Research Tools  |   Sensing/Imaging  |   Research Tools","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=4494","Michal Preminger, (617) 432-0920","Harvard University"

White","Tufts University Categories:semiconductor:lithographysemiconductor:MEMssemiconductor:processingsensorsAdditional Keywords:(none specified)Invention SummaryBackground:As feature sizes in the semiconductor industry continue to shrink, the importance of planarizing substrates both globally and locally grows.  Chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) is now the foremost nanomanufacturing process worldwide.  It has an annual economic impact over $1 billion and individual CMP processes are well established within certain enterprises.  Still, the ability to change CMP parameters and predict the effect this will have on material removal rates is not yet realized.  The CMP process is widely used and removal rates for certain systems have been characterized experimentally in terms of many of the polishing parameters, but a comprehensive model involving all variables and their effects on material removal rate and non-uniformity is lacking.Due to this limited understanding of a very important process, it is important to have as much in situ measurement data as possible.  This is useful in a production environment to be able to detect normal aging of the polishing pad or conditioner to know when to change them.  It would also be useful for detecting unexpected conditions that would result in a poor polish which could result in loss of product.  Invention:The invention consists of an array of micromachined shear stress sensors.  Each shear stress sensor in the array is a poly-dimethyl-siloxane (PDMS) post-in-well  µm scale structure.  It is intended for characterization of the local pad-wafer contact forces present during chemical-mechanical polishing.  Forces acting at the tips of the posts cause deflection of the tip.  This deflection is measured optically by a high speed camera, integrated with a microscope objective, relay lens, beam splitter, and fiber optic light source attached mechanically to the polishing rig.  Real-time images are captured at 10,000 frames per second. Sensors are able to measure forces ranging from 4 to 400 µN.The major advantages of the design are: (1) the small size, allowing high spatial resolution (2) the high resonant frequency and camera rate, allowing high temporal resolution (3) the chemically and electrically inert nature of the structure, allowing it to be used in the polishing environment."," Semiconductors  |   Semiconductors  |   Semiconductors","http://www.tufts.biz/cgi-bin/tech_search.cgi?r=1&case=T001500","Martin Son617-636-3605martin.son@tufts.edu","Tufts University"

In some cases, production and expression of miRNA can be used to at least partially inhibit or alter gene expression in plants. For instance, in some embodiments, a nucleotide sequence, which may encode a sequence substantially complementary to a gene to be inhibited or otherwise altered, may be prepared and inserted into a plant cell. Expression of the nucleotide sequence may cause the formation of precursor miRNA, which may, in turn, be cleaved (for example, with Dicer or other nucleases, including, for example, nucleases associated with RNA interference), to produce an miRNA sequence substantially complementary to the gene. The miRNA sequence may then interact with the gene (e.g., complementary binding) to inhibit the gene. In some cases, the nucleotide sequence may be an isolated nucleotide sequence. Other embodiments of the invention are directed to the precursor miRNA and/or the final miRNA sequence, as well as methods of making, promoting, and use thereof."," ","http://www.ipvisioninc.com/findurl.php?uid=mitDossier:10145W","Shawna Vogel","Massachusetts Institute of Technology"

The market for preventing ice formation is very large.  The ordered superhydrophobic surfaces of this invention have potential applications in various areas of industry, notably as anti-icing coatings on airplane wings, building exteriors, windshields, outdoor signs and electrical wires.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Professors Joanna Aizenberg of Harvard and Tom Krupenkin of the University of Wisconsin at Madison and their colleagues have invented a new method for using a microstructured, non-wetting surface to prevent ice formation on the surface. Current anti-icing technologies involve either the use of mechanical removal of ice (i.e. pneumatic wings), chemical coatings (i.e. chemical sprays), or input of heat. They found that superhydrophobic surfaces, such as an ordered array of microposts, are able to prevent ice accumulation over extended time periods without any input of heat or mechanical force. The surfaces are passive, and can be reproduced from inexpensive materials, such as polymers which could be formed into large area sheets.  Also, they have the advantage of designing their surfaces as ‘closed-cell’ structures to possess various properties such as increased mechanical strength, pressure stability, anisotropic dewetting, and low thermal conductivity. The figure below shows a brick patterned closed-cell microstructured surface, typical dimensions are h = 10 micron,  l and w are 25 micron and t = 5 micron.They have found that water droplets impacting their designed microstructured superhydrophobic surfaces have a limited contact time with the surface. Even under ice-forming conditions, droplets impinging cold superhydrophobic substrates bounce off the surface before freezing can occur.These kind of surfaces can be made by either imprinting a textured pattern into a hydrophobic surface, or by laying a polymer film containing the pattern onto the surface.  The figure below shows a potential industrial method of making such films.  There are a wide variety of such superhydrophobic, non-wetting surfaces that could be used in the novel method of this technology."," Nanotechnology/NEMS  |   Plastics and Polymers Engineering  |   Materials  |   Plastics and Polymers Engineering","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3573","Mick Sawka, (617) 496-3830","Harvard University"

"3909","Licensable Technology","Miniaturization of rotational velocity dependent fiber formation","Parker, Kevin Kit","MARKETS ADDRESSED:The invention is a portable and versatile setup for production of fibers for biomedical and industrial needs. Some possible applications include:•     Surgery: This system may be used in laparascopic surgeries. The size of the system allows for insertion through a catheter, port, or main artery. This system can be used for in vivo manufacturing of organs or tissues, for example a cylindrical organ, cavity filling tissue, or organ banding. •     Biofunctional suture threads: Very fine surgical sutured can be made of RJS fiber, possibly supplemented with growth factors of small molecules promoting healing and formation of new tissue. •     Tissue engineering: The ultrathin fiber mimics fibrous components of the native extracellular matrix and can encapsulate living cells, including stem cells. Fibers can be made from naturally occurring structural proteins – for example collagen or amyloid. These proteins provide an excellent support for additional components of natural extracellular matrix. Resulting materials can be used for a variety of clinical tasks:  surgical repair of bone, dental and muscle tissues, reinforcement of bodily membranes, sealing a leak, or providing a template for nerve growth. •     Drug delivery: Polymeric fibers may also be combined with other substances, such as therapeutic agents, in order to deliver such substances to the site of application of implantation of the fibers.•     In vitro analytical systems: While most healthcare products are still tested on animals, this approach is costly, time-consuming and ethically controversial. Reconstructed tissues address all of these concerns and become increasingly popular as a test platform. Small molecule or biological of interest can be applied to cells grown or tissue immobilized on RJS-made fibers and, subsequently, morphology, viability and other characteristics of cell population can be assessed. This tissue chip setup can be used in biotech R&D, clinical or regulatory testing settings.•     Non-biological uses: This apparatus may be used for non-medical or biologic applications – for example, reinforcing small cavities on high performance sporting or military equipment.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Spider silk is a unique material – strong, flexible and easy to stretch. So far humans have not been able to fully mimic arachnids’ ability to quickly woven high-quality protein fiber. Certain materials, such as Kevlar or Twaron possess similar mechanical properties, but are made of synthetic aramid fibers with limited biocompatibility. A portable device capable of quickly spinning together protein fibers would transform many applications – from assembling a tissue scaffold during a laparoscopic operation to producing a biodegradable and ultrastong industrial fibers.Rotary jet-spinning technology:  Researchers in Dr. Parker’s lab have invented rotary jet-spinning (RJS), a new cost effective, versatile and user friendly technique of nanofiber fabrication. In the approach, a polymer solution is flowed through a high-speed rotating nozzle to form a jet (figure A). Upon ejection, the jet thins due to centrifugal pressure, solvent evaporates and the fiber solidifies. The fiber is collected in a receiving reservoir of an arbitrary shape and the container dictates the form of the final fiber assembly. In the past the group has demonstrated utility of the approach for fabrication of synthetic materials. In the current opportunity, the technology has been updated to allow synthesis of polymer fibers.Fabrication of protein fibers: In addition to physical transformations, protein molecules can undergo conformational changes and folding/unfolding events. For example, the RJS apparatus can be equipped with an additional bridge – proteins would unfold while passing through salt or a pH gradient and then slowly refold in the formed fiber. This reversible transition can help with packing individual protein molecules into a tight thread and can improve mechanical properties of the final product. This is one of the principles employed by spiders and silk worms and now it is possible to replicate their highly efficient spinning technique in vitro.Miniaturization of the technology: Unlike some other fiber production methods, RJS does not require high-voltage electrical fields, which allows for miniaturization. At the moment the group has assembled a prototype that is small enough to fit in the palm. This apparatus can be used in a variety of settings, for example in an operating room during a laparoscopic surgery (figure b). The miniature setup can be used for production of both synthetic and protein fibers."," Materials","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3909","Mick Sawka, (617) 496-3830","Harvard University"

Altered activity of miRNAs is implicated in leukemogenesis and the pathogenesis of cancer in general. ||

miR-34a loss is observed in cases of glioma, neuroblastoma, pancreatic cancer, and chronic myelogenous leukemia. The lab of Judy Lieberman at Boston Children’s has demonstrated that miR-34a is a key regulator of hematopoiesis that acts as a tumor suppressor to help prevent blood cancers. By studying K562 cells, a progenitor blood cell line with the potential to differentiate into either megakaryocytes or red blood cells, the researchers found that miR-34a facilitates differentiation to a megakaryocyte state. miR-34a does this by decreasing expression of the transcription factor MYB, a key regulator of multiple decision forks in hematopoiesis. Also, the researchers found that overexpression of miR-34a induces cell cycle arrest and blocks proliferation by repressing CDK4 and CDK6. This supports the role of miR-34a as a tumor suppressor and suggests further exploration into the use of RNAi-based drugs to mimic tumor suppressor miRNAs or antagonize the function of oncogenic miRNAs in blood cancers."," Therapeutics - Drugs","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=2064","Dietz, Ryan, ryan.dietz@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"

Neumeyer, Ph.D.","It is generally believed that opioid receptor agonists, particularly kappa (¼) receptor agonists, can modulate the neurochemical and behavioral effects of cocaine. These effects may be caused by an inhibition or attenuation of the release of dopamine from dopaminergic neurons following cocaine administration. The present invention is based on the finding that certain ¼-agonists that have mixed activity at both ¼ and mu (chr(mu)) opioid receptors may decrease cocaine self-administration more effectively and with fewer undesirable side effects than can highly selective ¼-agonists. Therefore, mixed kappa/mu agonists appear to offer some advantages over selective ¼-agonists as potential treatments for cocaine abuse and other disorders characterized by dopaminergic dysfunction or dysregulation. Several novel compounds having such activity are featured in the invention. 
     Potential Commercial Uses: Based on traditional structure-activity relationships that have pinpointed structural features important for receptor binding, the inventor has synthesized a novel series of mixed kappa/mu opioids having high affinity for the opioid receptors. The compounds of the invention are potentially useful as treatments of addiction to cocaine or other drugs, possibly with fewer side effects than other drugs. The compounds may also be effective therapeutics against pain and diseases characterized by dopamine dysregulation, such as schizophrenia, ADHD or depression.

In general, higher power transmissions and transmissions of greater transmission length can be located with better accuracy by the Wireless Location System than lower power and shorter transmissions. Wireless communications systems generally limit the transmit power and transmission length of wireless transmitters in order to minimize interference within the communications system and to maximize the potential capacity of the system.

The most common of these is L-DOPA, the immediate precursor of dopamine, but which has complications in clinical use, including development of rapid fluctuations in mobility (so-called ""on-off"" effect).   Alternative treatments include drugs that directly mimic the actions of dopamine, including R(-)-apomorphine, a non-opioid, directly-acting dopamine agonist at both D1 and D2 receptors with no analgesic or addictive properties.   Although R(-)-apomorphine therapy can yield sustained improvements in Parkinson's patients whose treatment is accompanied by on-off motor changes, the drug is difficult to administer, poorly bioavailable by mouth, chemically unstable, and undergoes rapid metabolism to inactive metabolites.  These inventions comprise novel chemical compounds designed for better specificity at the dopamine receptors and to overcome the problems encountered with apomorphine, particularly its lack of oral bioavailability and short half-life.  The inventors have made specific modifications at certain positions of R(-)-apomorphine, designed to alter the molecule's receptor binding properties, to create derivatives of the molecule with enhanced neuropharmacological properties.   Molecular modifications have resulted in compounds having increased selectivity for the D2 receptor (higher potency at D2, lower at D1), or in being able to discriminate the high affinity and low affinity states of the D2 receptor, with correspondingly greater behavioral potency and duration of action with oral as well as systemic administration in animal models.

Drug Discovery:•     Members of the FUS family are potential drug targets. Using a proprietary mini-nuclear extract system in combination with a conditional FUS knockdown cell line will be used to determine the role of FUS in ALS pathogenesis vis a vis RNAP, U1 snRNP, and Gem expression to screen for potential ALS therapeutics.•     Cost effective and robust method for high throughput screening of compoundsusing standard and cheap cell lines like HeLa cells carrying a mutant FUS geneor other ALS genotypes associated with lowered Gems frequency, using standard imaging techniques and software to quantify the frequency of Gems before and after exposure to compounds.•     A broadened spectrum of therapeutics can be tested, for e.g., compounds thattreat spinal muscular atrophy.•     Traditional approaches to drug discovery in ALS have focused on single drugtargets (e.g., ceftriaxone for the glutamate receptor) or mechanistic improvementin muscle or mitochondrial function whereas this technology relies on a positiveeffect on a critical cellular hallmark that is the result of an optimally functioningbiochemical pathway preceding mechanistic function, therefore, enhancing thechances of successful drug development.2. Drug Development:•     Useful in proof of concept and dose response studies in initial as well as Phase 3clinical trials. The recovery of Gems frequency can be established as a validclinical endpoint along with the ALS function retaining scale.•     Expression profiling and the activity of various alleles identified within the SMNcomplex by the Reed group has the potential to aid in patient stratification withinclinical trials, increasing chances of success. Current trials have failed partly dueto the fact that ALS patients are lumped together.3. Personalized medicine:The frequency of Gems and SMN associated protein function as well as ALSpatient expression profiles will be useful in prescribing appropriate therapies atoptimal doses4. Diagnostics: There are currently no definitive diagnostics for ALS.  Current diagnostics include a battery of tests including a neurological exam, MRI, and nerve conduction tests.  The technology enables a non-invasive diagnostic using light microscopy to determine Gem levels.•     The quantification of Gem frequency is easily done using imaging from easilyobtainable non-neuronal patient samples (urine, saliva, blood, etc.).•     Expression profiling and SNP analysis of associated alleles can be done usingstandard microarray or genomics techniques.•     Phenotypic profiling of SMN proteins is performed by co-immunoprecipitationor other standard protein analysis techniques that are the part of a standarddiagnostics laboratory.•     The ease of obtaining samples and testing makes it cost-effective and attractivefor a diagnostic company because no new capital investment is required tointroduce a test for ALS.•     The combination of genotypic and phenotypic tests can serve as a useful initial diagnosis tool for identifying ALS predisposition or an individualINNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease that results in spasticity and ultimate death, has perplexed researchers and drug developers over the decades because of the lack of an identifiable pathway or pattern for pathogenesis and disease progression. The complexity and multi-environmental nature of cellular abnormalities that lead to neuronal dysfunction have traditionally made it a difficult drug target, leading to several high profile drug failures, most notably, ceftriaxone (MGH) and dexpramipexole (Biogen Idec) that have shown great success in animal models but poor translational success in clinical trials. The variable disease states of ALS in humans, a panel of variable genetic causes, and its sporadic manifestation in some individuals, has considerably complicated drug development. This has been compounded by the lack of consistent biomarkers associated with ALS, thus creating a need for reliable pan-ALS genotype diagnostic tests that can be easily performed by simple non-neuronal sample collection of blood, saliva and urine to identify individuals with predisposition to ALS, diagnosis of ALS and for patient stratification in clinical trials.This technology is based on the finding that severe, as well as sporadic, ALS cases resulting from mutations in several alleles associated with ALS onset (such as TDP-43, FUS and SOD1) ultimately lead to a defect in RNA metabolism and loss of Gems in ALS patient fibroblasts -- coiled nuclear bodies that contain a protein important for RNA processing, called SMN or “survivor of motor neurons” that was traditionally associated with spinal muscular dystrophy, but has now been implicated in ALS as well. The Reed group has also identified several proteins that form a part of the complex associated with the SMN protein that can be used for phenotypic activity based or genotypic diagnosis of ALS. The lowered frequency of Gems in ALS patient fibroblasts, and the easily quantifiable expression profiles and phenotypic properties of SMN-associated alleles and their protein products have broad implications in ALS drug discovery, development and diagnostics.RNA-binding protein FUS (FUsued in Sarcoma), also identified as hnRNP P2, is a subunit of a complex involved in the maturation of pre-mRNA.  FUS is predominantly a nuclear protein, but can shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm.  In addition, FUS has been shown to influence transcription initiation via interaction with several nuclear receptors. Fourteen FUS mutations have been implicated in ALS, specifically the type6 phenotype.  Significantly, most of the FUS mutations so far found to cause ALS are located at the C-terminus of the protein. This region contains a nuclear localization sequence for transportin, which is required for nuclear import of FUS as well as other hnRNP proteins.  Moreover, mutations in TDP43, another protein involved in mRNA maturation, have been implicated in the development of ALS.The observation that both TDP43 and FUS have similar functional properties in transcription/splicing raises the possibility that these steps in gene expression are central to ALS pathogenesis.Researchers report that FUS specifically associates with the SMN (survival of motor neuron) complex, a protein known to mediate RNP assembly.  SMN is consistently enriched in foci termed “Gems”.  Therefore, Gem expression can be used a surrogate of FUS activity, potential providing providing both a drug discovery and diagnostic platform for ALS."," Drug Discovery Tools","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=4135","Grant Zimmermann, (617) 495-3067","Harvard University"

"JDP-060","Licensable Technology","Modulation of Nitric Oxide Synthase","George Liang King, M.D.","Certain insulin-related disorders are characterized by low levels of the important chemical messenger nitric oxide (NO). This is likely due to the fact that insulin, when present in the cell, stimulates expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) at the mRNA level, and expression of this enzyme leads to NO synthesis. In diabetes or other insulin-related disorders, the lack of insulin leads to low NO levels. It has further been found that activation of a specific protein kinase inhibits insulin-stimulated NO synthase expression. The invention therefore comprises the use of inhibitors of this kinase to restore or augment the pathway in cells lacking insulin, thereby increasing the amounts of NO produced. This is useful for conditions like hypertension. The invention therefore provides novel potential strategies for the modulation of nitric oxide synthesis, using agonists or antagonists of the protein kinase. The major anticipated uses would be to use inhibitors of the kinase to prevent the kinase from shutting down NOS expression, thereby restoring NO levels to normal. This strategy could be used to alleviate low NO levels found in patients suffering from diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis, or other insulin-related disorders. In situations where there was excess NO in the cell, one could use agonists of the kinase to block NO synthase and reduce NO levels.

The enzymes in the group phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3Ks) are believed to play an important role in regulating glucose transport into cells as a result of insulin signaling. Insulin binding to its receptor triggers the phosphorylation of IRS molecules. It is believed that the PI3Ks associate with IRS molecules and modify the cell membrane by phosphorylating key membrane components, which increases glucose transport into the cell. The inventors have discovered the portion of the PI3K enzyme that interacts with the IRS proteins, and have also found that glucose transport can be modulated by modulating the activity of this portion of PI3K. The invention therefore comprises methods of treating insulin-related disorders by modulating glucose transport into the cell, either by increasing or decreasing the activity of PI3Ks, specifically, by up- or down-regulating the portion of the PI3K enzyme that interacts with the IRS proteins. This can be accomplished in several ways, e.g., inhibiting the PI3K/IRS interaction by peptides that bind the important protein of PI3K, using antisense molecules to block transcription, or increasing gene expression in any of several ways.

In solid tumors, such as basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the most prevalent cancer in the Caucasian population, and medulloblastoma (MB), the most common childhood brain cancer, constitutive activation of the Hh pathway within tumor cells leads directly to the initiation of the tumor. In other cancers, Hh signals from tumor cells appear to condition the local environment to favor tumor growth. This category includes a broad spectrum of high incidence cancers, particularly those in breast, lung, liver, stomach, pancreas, prostate, and gastro-intestinal tract. Broad screens for small-molecule inhibitors of Hh signaling have identified an essential membrane protein, Smoothened (Smo), as a druggable target. Two inhibitors (GDC-0449 [Genentech] and HPI926 [Infinity Pharmaceuticals]) have entered clinical trials. Phase I trials with GDC-0449, examining invasive or metastatic forms of BCC and medullablastoma, clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of anti-Smo agents in a number of patients. The studies also highlight the need for additional drugs to overcome drug resistant mutations that occur within Smo.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Executive Summary:•     An image-based high content screen for novel modulators of the Hedgehog pathway. •     Direct analysis of drug effects on Smoothened (Smo) translocation and accumulation in the primary cilium.•     A pilot screen of 8,000 compounds identified 26 Smo antagonists •     Optimized screen in progress•     Secondary screens to explore toxicity, specificity, potency and inhibitory activity on both wild-type and mutant forms of Smo resistant to current treatments.•     Submicromolar hit identified•     Structure-activity relationship (SAR) data and analogs are available.•     Demonstration of  direct interaction with Smo and inhibition of Hh signalingProfessors Andrew McMahon and Lee Rubin of Harvard University have jointly developed an image-based assay for selective identification of novel modulators of the Hedgehog pathway. This novel high content screen focuses on the critical biology of Smo action. Smo is only active when present within a specific cell organelle, the primary cilium. By tagging Smo, and a non-Hh regulated cilial protein, with distinct fluorescent tags, our scientists are able to directly observe Smo movement into or out of the primary cilium (Wang et al, 2009). A pilot screen of 8,000 compounds, primarily from annotated and natural product-like libraries, identified 26 Smo antagonists. One of the hits has an IC50 of 0.8 µM. Structure-activity relationships (SAR) data of this hit and its analogs that inhibit Smo translocation are available. Using secondary assays developed in the Harvard labs, our scientists have shown a direct interaction of the hit compound with Smo and inhibition of Hh signaling.The scientists have optimized the screen and are screening additional compound libraries to to identify a larger set of compounds that block Hh ligand-dependent Smo accumulation within the primary cilium. Secondary screens are in place to explore toxicity, specificity, potency and inhibitory activity on both wild-type and mutant forms of Smo that are resistant to current treatments. SAR will be probed using analogs of hit compounds. In addition, Smo antagonists will be analyzed for the suitability of further medicinal chemistry optimization and analysis in animal studies."," Therapeutics - Drugs","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3741","Vivian Berlin, (617) 496-0474","Harvard University"

The mold fails to avoid rupture, or even distortion, of the casting. A thin shell of ceramic defines the casting cavity. This shell must be thin enough to fail due to the stresses induced (primarily compressive) by the metal next to it and partly adherent to it. A support structure is provided with a morphology that supports the thin shell that defines the casting geometry, yet that also fails as the casting solidifies and/or cools. Typically, the support structure is a skeletal network with voids therebetween. The skeletal elements may be struts, or sheets or both. At least the following two failure mechanisms may be exploited in the design of the support structure: bending in the structure; and under compressive loads, either by buckling of a support member or, breakage under compressive loading.

"672","Licensable Technology","Molecular Database for Antibody Characterization","Mentzer, S","Quantitative flow cytometry (FC) captures the complexity of monoclonal antibody (mAb) binding interactions on a per-cell (or per-particle) basis.  The resulting FC histogram contains a wealth of information; careful interpretation of this data is key to capturing the power of this technique. This invention provides a computer repository of FC histograms accessible through the internet.  Search algorithms allow the user to obtain information concerning mAbs that meet selection criteria.  Novel algorithms allow for comparison of histograms across several mAbs, cell types and subpopulations within cell types.  The database is not stagnant-new histograms will be added as users submit mAbs for FC analysis against a panel of cell types.  The database will be continually be updated with this histogram information.  New mAbs may produce histograms that do not correspond to known patterns; discussion threads on the website will guide the identification of these potentially novel mAbs. 

Applications/Advantages: Because the generation of mAbs depends upon complex biologic processes, the characterization of novel mAbs can be unpredictable, expensive, and time-consuming.  A database approach can significantly reduce expenditures in both time and cost.  The Leukocyte Differentiation Antigen Database contains cytometry data, however these data were compiled across multiple laboratories, confounding comparison among mAbs.   In contrast, this technology features data compiled under equivalent conditions in the same laboratory, and between-lab variability is eliminated from the comparison.  Furthermore, this invention provides a well-defined algorithm for the comparison of complex FC histograms.  Currently, investigators often compare pairs of histograms by eye. The computer-based algorithm approach is both more objective and amenable to database-wide comparisons."," Bioinformatics","http://www.dfci.harvard.edu/res/technology/available.asp?case_number=672&keywords=672&category_id=&category_name=Search+Results","Elena Moir, Phone (617) 632-4018, Fax (617) 632-4012, Email elena_moir@dfci.harvard.edu","Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"

Instead the techniques investigate and discover the multiple complex correlations that form between various radiation emission wavelengths during a plasma process, and do not impose an expectation for a specific correlation or trend between the various wavelengths. The discovered correlations found to exist between the radiation wavelengths are then employed for monitoring a plasma process based on the discovered correlations.

"3844","Licensable Technology","Monolithically-integrated graphene structures as sensors","Lieber, Charles M.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Carbon graphene structures may revolutionize the field of post-silicon electronics.  However, a number of technical limitations prevent the advancement and widespread adoption of graphene nanolayer devices and components.  The technology described here solves a number of those challenges by allowing for a single-step synthesis of a large number of monolithic graphene structures as well as the integration of graphene components with other circuit components made from carbon.  This technology allows for the creation of a whole new class of graphene-based components and circuits.  For example, the multilayer graphene structures synthesized with this technology can be transferred onto both rigid and flexible substrates, such as transparent plastic films, enabling a wide range of applications (see Figure 1).  The single-step synthesis process allows for the creation of a range of devices, including sensors.  For example, this technology can be used to create a monolithic graphene/graphite field-effect transistor (FET) device array that allows for real-time, multiplexed sensing, such as voltage, pH and, with the proper functionalization, sensing of biomolecules.  An example FET biosensor is a macromolecule protein sensor with antibody receptors linked to the sensor’s graphene layer as shown in Figure 2.  This micro-scale sensor allows for the detection of minute amounts of specific proteins in solution for a large range of medical, drug development, and safety inspection applications.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Graphene is a single, atomic-layer thick two-dimensional sheet of bonded carbon atoms that is characterized by superb electric and mechanical properties, thermal conductivity, and optical transparency.  Graphene is a promising candidate material for post-silicon microfabrication due to its high carrier mobility.  However, current graphene device manufacturing processes do not address the need to integrate the graphene layer with electrodes for fabricating a range of device components based on graphene materials, such as FETs and electrical interconnects.This invention allows for the single-step chemical vapor deposition (CVD) graphene synthesis process to build monolithically-integrated electronic devices with structures and regions of varying numbers of graphene layers to produce a range of elements, including graphene channels and graphite electrodes.  The single-step synthesis technique also enables the production of an entire device area, including interconnect lines, in a single step and the assembly of multiple components of FETs on flexible and transparent plastic films (Figure 1).  In contrast to the multiple processing steps required in conventional complementary metaloxide- semiconductor (CMOS) microfabrication, this single-step process allows for the synthesis and integration of complex graphene devices, such as the fabrication of flexible semitransparent graphene FET arrays, graphene biosensors, and pH sensor arrays.  For example, this invention allows for the straightforward fabrication of single or arrays of the protein biosensors illustrated in Figure 2.A BFigure 1: Flexible and semitransparent topgate monolithic graphene FET arrays. (A) Schematic illustration of the device layout. (B) Photograph (main panel) of the devices wrapped on a cylindrical glass (radius of curvature: 1.2 cm).

"3719","Licensable Technology","Motion compensating catheter for beating heart surgery","Howe, Robert D.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:To repair damage and defects within a heart, doctors currently use stopped-heart and open-chest surgeries. These procedures are highly invasive and incur a significant risk to the patient from neurological impairment to possible death. The technology covered by this invention provides a device for performing surgery within a heart while it is beating. This gives physicians a minimally invasive tool to perform structural repairs or electrophysiological procedures on a beating heart with the same accuracy as open-chest surgeries. This technology can non-invasively perform procedures with extreme accuracy, such procedures could include; atrial septal defect closures, mitral valve annuloplasty procedures, cardiac tissue resection or precision cardiac biopsies.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:This technology allows one to perform surgery on a heart while it is in motion. The technology is embodied by a fast, motion compensating mechanical device that uses image guidance and a sophisticated software package to anticipate and react to the rapid movement of the cardiac tissue of interest.  The device, which can either be in the form of a handheld tool or a standard cardiac catheter, allows a technician to perform very delicate surgeries such, such as mitral valve repair, without the need for heart stopping techniques. The technology takes advantage of real-time 3-D ultrasound images and a Radon transform-based algorithm for processing.The system is composed of an actuated catheter module that is inserted inside the heart, a 3D ultrasound imaging system that views the catheter and the tissue of interest, and a visual servoing system that commands the mechanized device to follow a specific trajectory based on the 3D imaging information (See Fig. 1). The catheter module is inserted into the heart by the physician where it then braces itself against the heart structures while the end effector compensates for the motion of the moving tissue and applies a specific repair, such as stapling an implantable prosthesis or resecting tissue around a valve (Fig. 2, Left). 3D ultrasound imaging allows both the tissue and the catheter tool to be visualized and tracked at video frame rates in real-time (Fig. 2, right). The visual servoing system then extracts both the tool and tissue trajectory from this visual information and determines how the catheter should be moved to compensate for the cardiac motion.This technology offers a number of advantages over current heart repair approaches. First, this catheter-based approach allows for sophisticated heart repair to be performed without the considerable morbidities associated with large incisions in the chest, the use of the heart-lung bypass machine, or heavy sedation.  This decrease in the invasiveness of these procedures will allow life-saving cardiac repair procedures to be expanded to a larger pool of potential patients who are too old or sick for a traditional open-heart procedure.  Another benefit is that the system operates on a beating heart, thus enabling the clinician to evaluate the quality of the repair during the procedure.  Finally, the system will save money on each procedure because they will take less time than traditional open-heart repair, the patient will have a shorter recovery time, and require less personal to complete. This novel technology is a potential solution for heart valve repair, such as mitral valve annuloplasty, cardiac tissue resection, precision cardiac biopsies, cardiac electrophysiology procedures, and heart defect closures. All of these procedures could be improved or be made minimally invasive if performed with this technology.  To reconfigure the system to perform a different procedure, only the catheter end effector needs to be replaced. The majority of the capital investment hardware can be shared among a range of procedures.Fig. 1. The catheter system consists of a drive system, a catheter module, and a 3DUS visual servoing system.  The system compensates for the fast motion of the cardiac tissue using 3D ultrasound imaging and visual servoing system to while the surgeon performs the repair procedure. Fig. 2.

"784","Licensable Technology","Mouse Hepatitis Virus Screen Based on Real-Time Quantitative Molecular Beacons","Horner, J","Mouse colonies often house rare, expensive transgenic animals and transplantable cell lines; an outbreak of Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV) can devastate an entire colony in a matter of weeks and require years for recovery. Recent discoveries the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute provide methods for a rapid, cost effective and reliable assay for the detection and monitoring of MHV infections in laboratory mice. These methods rely upon an identified nucleotide sequence in the MHV genome that is conserved across all known MHV strains (including ML-11, ML-10, MHV-A59, Penn 97-1, JHM, and MHV strains 1 and 2). This technology provides primers and probes for this conserved region of the MHV genome, which may be used to detect MHV sequences in a sample. Molecular beacons are especially suitable probes, as they provide not only highly sensitive MHV detection, but also a means for differentiating among the MHV strains.

Applications/Advantages: Serology is currently the dominant method of testing for MHV. However, serological testing is expensive and time-consuming. More recent assays based upon RT-PCR are often unreliable, since they lack the required sensitivity for screening large numbers of test samples or they fail to diagnose all MHV strains. Since this technology relies upon a conserved sequence, it can provide accurate results across several strains. Further, serological testing typically requires one week from receipt of serum to obtain test data. In contrast, results from the molecular beacon assay can easily be obtained within eight hours in fecal samples. By shortening the time between sampling and MHV detection, the chances that MHV may spread throughout the colony are diminished."," Diagnostics/Biomarkers","http://www.dfci.harvard.edu/res/technology/available.asp?case_number=784&keywords=&category_id=5&category_name=Diagnostics","Elena Moir, Phone (617) 632-4018, Fax (617) 632-4012, Email elena_moir@dfci.harvard.edu","Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"

"JDM-005","Licensable Technology","Mouse Obesity Model with Modified Leptin Receptor","Martin Myers, M.D., Ph.D.  et al.","The hormone leptin regulates food intake, metabolic rate and endocrine function. Disruption of leptin or its receptor molecule abolishes normal regulatory mechanisms, leading to obesity and endocrine dysfunction. The leptin receptor activates certain signal transduction pathways that mediate its normal roles in the cell. The inventors have discovered that certain signaling pathways of the leptin receptor play a role in control of body weight, while distinct pathways control other functions such as fertility. To distinguish these pathways, transgenic mice were created in which the long form of the leptin receptor is mutated to replace the tyrosine at position 1138 with a serine. Phosphorylation of Tyr 1138 is known to mediate activation of the transcription factor STAT3, which triggers the weight control pathways. Mice mutated at this locus become obese without losing other functions such as fertility. The available technology features transgenic mice, homozygous for the serine 1138 substitution in the long form leptin receptor. Like db/db mice, the leprS1138 homozygotes are hyperphagic and obese, but unlike db/db mice, are fertile, long in size, and less hyperglycemic. These mice therefore comprise a model of human obesity that may have distinct advantages over other commonly available models."," Research Reagents","http://www.joslinresearch.org/inventions","David J.

Developed in 2009, Filter Aided Sample Preparation (FASP), which utilizes ultrafiltration membranes, is the current accepted standard for the processing of samples for proteomic analysis. ||

Researchers in Dr. Hanno Steen’s laboratory at Boston Children’s have developed a novel sample processing workflow, MStern blotting, which retains many of the strengths of FASP while overcoming several of its major limitations. MStern blotting relies on the physical adsorption of proteins onto a membrane instead of size exclusion due to ultrafiltration membranes. This reduces the force required for efficient liquid transfer, and decreases the processing time for 96-well plates, a common high-throughput format, such that 96 samples can be completely processed within less than a workday. The MStern method has been tested on a variety of samples (urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and whole cell lysates) and has been demonstrated to produce comparable or even better results as compared to FASP."," Diagnostics/Biomarkers  |   Research Tools","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=2563","Caron, Connie, connie.caron@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"

"03304","Licensable Technology","Mulitecho Bandwidth Matched Sequences for Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Tissue Segmentation","Fischl, Bruce R.; van der Kouwe, Andre J. W.","The Technology:
A multiecho version of the MPR (MEMPR) was developed that allows bandwidth and hence distortion matching with MEF and T2-SPACE, with no SNR penalty because the SNR can be recovered by combining the multiple echoes. The MEMPR parameters can be chosen to produce GM-WM-CSF contrast similar to the more standard single echo MPR, while providing dramatically reduced B0 distortions that precisely match the other scans. Furthermore, the T2* information inherent in the multiple echoes of the MEMPR can be used to segment tissues such as dura that frequently confound cortical thickness estimates in regions where dura and cortex are adjacent.

Application:
-automatic cortical/subcortical segmentation

Advantages:
-if a higher bandwidth is used, distortions due to B0 inhomogeneities (susceptibility distortions) are reduced 
-greater flexibility in the choice of bandwidth allows bandwidth matching between various sequence types without compromising with respect to SNR. 
-additional information is encoded in the relationship between the images with different echo times - the images can thus be combined in such a way as to emphasize or reduce the contrast between chosen anatomical structures. 
-the multiecho aspect can be exploited to distinguish tissues with different T2* relaxation times e.g. dura from cortex, fat from muscle.
-the ability to distinguish dura from cortex can be used to improve cortical segmentation i.e. improve the quality of the cortical outer surface that is estimated from MR images esp. in regions where dura and cortex are adjacent."," Software  |   Medical Imaging","http://www.partners.org/techtransfer/availabletechnologies/default.asp","Heonick Ha, hha@partners.org, 617-954-9324","Massachusetts General Hospital"

The cardiac functions can be determined by formulating an auto-regression moving average model utilizing either finite impulse response systems or a group of infinite impulse response systems. Both of these models identify the system functions by solving a set of linear equations using the least-squares method. The system input is then identified by deconvolving the system output and the estimated impulse response of each channel. These models can be augmented to obtain an estimate of the maximum order of the cardiac functions when they are unknown a priori.

"03887","Licensable Technology","Multimodal Imaging of Fibrin","Caravan, Peter","Technology: 
Fibrin is a major component of blood clots and is found in all thrombi. Fibrin is often associated with solid tumors as well as with complex atherosclerotic plaques. This makes fibrin a useful imaging target for detection of cancer, stroke, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction, angina, and vulnerable plaque. The inventor has created a novel peptide-based fibrin-specific imaging probe to allow high-resolution, high-sensitivity detection of fibrin using hybrid MR-PET or PET-CT imaging. This hybrid imaging technique allows for whole-body thrombus detection. The probe can also be modified for use with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or near-infrared (NIR) imaging.

Applications: 
This imaging probe can be used to detect thrombi and other diseases associated with fibrin, including cancer, stroke, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction, angina, and vulnerable plaque. For example, it may be useful in identifying the source of embolus in stroke, and in guiding and monitoring treatment to prevent a second stroke. 

Advantages:
- High spatial resolution of MRI or CT combined with molecular specificity of PET allows for precise localization of thrombus/fibrin.
- Hybrid probe enables whole-body detection, allowing thrombi/fibrin to be detected anywhere in the body in just one imaging session.
- Simple chemical structure of peptide-based probes yields lower production costs and improved pharmacokinetics over existing fibrin imaging agents.

"CCMC   2144","Licensable Technology","Multiple Antigen Presentation System (MAPS)","Malley, Richard","Dr. Malley's lab has designed a flexible vaccine system utilizing a polysaccharide (PS) as the scaffold and a coupling system whereby a number of proteins could collectively be bound tightly to the PS. In vivo, this system can prime not only strong antibody against PS, but also specific B cell and T cell responses to protein antigens. This technique enables the rapid creation of complex vaccines that can include various components from one or multiple organisms in the same vaccine construct, especially for diseases where a combination of antibody and T cell immunity is beneficial. For example, one could envision making a vaccine using a pneumococcal PS that is bound to several pneumococcal proteins and/or tuberculosis proteins, making a multivalent pneumococcal vaccine or a combined pneumococcal/TB vaccine.  ||

The present invention relates to vaccine consisting of an immunogenic complex with at least one type of PS backbone, a number of protein antigens (â‰¤6), and at least one coupling system comprising (i) one molecule which associates with the polysaccharide, and (ii) a complementary molecule which associates with the antigen, to attach the antigen to the polysaccharide.  ||

The product would be a macromolecular complex vaccine including a PS to which a coupling molecule has been attached that then is used to bind a host of proteins that have the complementary coupling moiety fused to them.

"MCL 1937.0","Licensable Technology","N-Substituted Derivatives of Morphinan and Uses Thereof","John Neumeyer, Ph.D., et al.","It is generally believed that opioid receptor agonists, particularly kappa (k) receptor agonists, can modulate the neurochemical and behavioral effects of cocaine. These effects may be caused by an inhibition or attenuation of the release of dopamine from dopaminergic neurons following cocaine administration. The present invention is based on the finding that nonselective k-agonists that can also induce m-receptor-mediated effects can decrease cocaine self-administration more effectively and with fewer undesirable side effects than can highly selective k-agonists. Several novel compounds having this activity are included in the invention. These compounds also have relatively low affinity for the d receptor and should therefore not produce the side effects associated with activity at this receptor.
     Potential Commercial Uses: The compounds of the invention are potentially useful as treatments of cocaine abuse, possibly with fewer side effects than other drugs. The compounds can also be radioactively labeled with F-18 for positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, or with I-123 for single photon computed tomography (SPECT) imaging. Such labeled compounds could be used for imaging the localization and density of k receptors in the brain, and determining if this changes as a result of cocaine use or other stimuli.

The nano-heater technology utilizes significant advances in nanoscience research to address the current technical constraints with thermal heating in nanomanufacturing . The selectivity and control of Nano-Heaters will lead to dramatic reduction in thermal budgets and superior processing quality in annealing, oxidation and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of semiconductors.  Thermal self-processing of electronics with layered sources patterns will obviate the compromised performance and expense of rapid thermal processing (RTP) reactors and furnaces.  Up to now, the need for external connections with macroscale power supplies has negated many of the benefits of miniaturization."," Nanotechnology  |   Nano-heaters  |   Controlled Heating","http://uml.flintbox.com/public/project/7990/","Rajnish Kaushik, Ph.D., Assistant Director, OTC, Umass Lowell, Ph:978-934-4708/978-935-6592, Email: Rajnish_Kaushik@uml.edu","University of Massachusetts Lowell"

"2310","Licensable Technology","Nanometer patterning with ice","Golovchenko, Jene","MARKETS ADDRESSED:These inventions (see also case 2440) involve the use of gases directly solidified onto cryogenically cooled substrates to form conformal thin films as resists for lithographically patterning the substrates.  Examples of such gases are water vapor and rare gases, such as argon.  Water as a resist is placed on the substrate directly from the gas phase, patterned with an energetic beam (electron, ion or light), and then the rest is removed by sublimation.  Electron or ion beams were shown to sublimate water ice from silicon substrates and to allow the patterning of the substrate with sub-20nm metal lines. This excellent resolution was accomplished without any attempts to optimize the process and with 5nm diameter beams and can likely be improved. The use of frozen gaseous resists appears not to suffer from the proximity effects seen with polymer resists which lessen the pattern resolution available with polymer resists. Another use of the frozen gaseous resists is to hold 1D substrates rigid allowing them to be cut. Carbon nanotubes coated with water ice were easily cut using an ion beam - this is a major advance in the field because previously there was no reliable way of cutting nanotubes at predetermined locations.  A further surprising discovery is that some resists and substrates can chemically react in the presence of the energy released by the beam and leave a thin film of reactant in a pattern determined by the beam. Water as a resist on silicon substrate and then exposed to an electron beam left a thin coating of silicon oxide.  This discovery opens up a new way of placing a very thin film of silica dielectric in any predetermined pattern and could be very useful in the microelectronics fabrication.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:This technology has numerous advantages over standard polymer resists such as: a) gentler conditions (no spinning on of slurries, no baking at elevated temperatures, no exposure to liquid surface tension), b) economic (fewer steps, no expensive polymer resists and no toxic solvents to dispose), c) broader array of substrates can be patterned from standard 2D planar inorganic substrates to 3D fragile substrates such as biological substrates to 1D substrates such as nanotubes and nanowires,  d) cleaner processing (all steps occur in a single vacuum chamber, removal of unexposed condensed gasses leaves minimal residues)."," Nanotechnology  |   Nanotechnology  |   Materials","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=2310","Alan Gordon, (617) 384-5000","Harvard University"

"3782","Licensable Technology","Nanoparticle targeting to ischemia or Cancer for imaging and therapy","Mooney, David J.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Potential applications for this invention are as follows:Diagnosis and treatment of ischemia: It can be applied to various types of ischemia, including cerebrovascular ischemia, renal ischemia, limb ischemia, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and myocardial ischemia. The nanoparticles can be coupled with fluorescent dyes, radioactive molecules, or paramagnetic compounds, for use with various methods of imaging.Diagnosis and treatment of Cancer: Tumor microenvironment is often characterized in aggressive growth of new, aberrant blood vessels. These nanoparticles can be used to transport anti-angiogenic or anti-tumor proteins to tumors. Similarly, these nanoparticles could also be useful for diagnosing tumors that have leaky blood vessels, which are more likely of forming metastases.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Ischemia occurs when blood flow and oxygen are prevented from reaching a part of the body. This can occur in many different locations, including the brain, the heart, the intestines, or the limbs. Within a relatively short amount of time, untreated ischemia can lead death at the site of injury, and a growing circle of damage in neighboring cells. Both diagnostic and treatment modalities are highly invasive and rely on the fast identification of the pathology and its anatomic location: Ischemia diagnosis can be quite difficult; arteriograms are commonly used, involving dye injection through catheters into blood vessels and x-rays for observing blood flow. Treatment is aimed at removal of the blood clot which is the direct cause of ischemia.Success rate of interventional therapies is also time sensitive and depends highly on immediate symptom detection.  Conventional methods include TPA, which dissolves the blot clot and can be administered intravenously or directly into ischemic site, and emergency surgery that aims at removing the clot or graft bypass vessels to restore blood flow. There is a need for faster and less invasive imaging methods for identifying tissues affected by ischemia, as well as a need for targeted treatments that will minimize damage to the surrounding area and promote tissue healing.This method uses nanoparticles for protein delivery, which could be made out of a wide variety of materials. Accumulating  in areas of leaky blood vessels is often observed in Liposomes have previously been used to target ischemic myocardial tissue. In addition, angiogenesis-promoting factors are well known. However, liposomes have not yet been combined with therapeutic molecules."," Medical Imaging","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3782","Jessica Duda, (617) 495-3067","Harvard University"

Technology platformInvention SummaryBusiness OpportunityResearchers at Tufts University have introduced silk as a disruptive new material platform across multiple micro- and nano-scale technologies by combining the unique features of the silk protein family with optics and photonics.  This merging of biology and optical physics creates sophisticated, multi-functional, silk-based optical sensing systems with target focus areas in environmental detection, renewable energy, and the life sciences.  The silk sensor technology platform enables the detection and monitoring of a variety of contaminants through its versatile chemistry and processing and will directly embed an advanced optical interface offering immediate and easy read out.  These systems are biocompatible, disposable, degradable, consumable, and distributable. The distinctive properties offered by silk materials will be at the core of the development of innovative products that address unmet needs across several market areas.Why Silk?Silk is a revolutionary material that can outperform plastics, inorganic polymers, foams, glass and add unforeseen functions to technologies where conventional materials are used.- It is the strongest natural fiber available- It is biocompatible- It has insulating properties comparable to the best ceramics- It is >99 percent transparent across the visible spectrum- It can be manufactured in a variety of shapes and sizesBackgroundThis promising technology platform originates from the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Tufts University and combines the foremost worldwide silk expertise of biomedical engineers with optical physicists and materials scientists to generate a radically new class of multifunctional materials that can be handled like a crystal, a flexible film or an optical waveguide while embedding active biological features, such as living materials.  To date, novel biocompatible and biodegradable components - silk lenses, lens arrays, waveguides, gratings, and holograms - have been developed.  Protein immobilization has also been successfully achieved in silk films, including enzymes, antibodies, peptides, and small molecules.Target MarketsThe silk processing technology developed at Tufts enables unprecedented control over material properties.  Silk can be realized in a variety of shapes and sizes with precise command over its material properties (i.e. strength, flexibility, transparency, hydrophobicity) and dimensions (with controlled features that range from <10 nm to several centimeters) to enable optical interfaces and biological functions. The initial markets identified (life sciences, environmental sensing, high-performance materials and renewable energy) are directly empowered by the complete biocompatibility and biodegradability of silk along with its material properties - a combination not found in conventional polymers.Life Sciences and Biomedical- Implantable diagnostic devices- Medical multifunctional sensors- Biocompatible lab on chipHigh Performance Biomaterials- Ultralight weight components- Electronics integration- Optical and electro-optical devicesEnvironmental and Biological Sensors- Sensors for water quality monitoring- Biodegradable dissolvable sensors- Biosensors for virus/bacteria detectionRenewable Energy- Silk based solar cells- Supercapacitors- Eco-friendly electronics"," Environment  |   Sensing/Imaging  |   Environment  |   Sensing/Imaging  |   Environment","http://www.tufts.biz/cgi-bin/tech_search.cgi?r=1&case=T001430","Martin Son617-636-3605martin.son@tufts.edu","Tufts University"

"20547","Licensable Technology","Nanoporous gold multiple electrode array (np-Au MEA)","Berdichevsky, Yevgeny ; Seker, Erkin ; Yarmush, Martin L.","Dr. Erkin Seker and colleagues invented a simple, scalable, and repeatable technique to produce nanoporous gold electrode arrays for electrophysiological applications. The low impedance of the array provides a superior signal-to-noise ratio for detection of neural activity in noisy environments. They demonstrated the utility of the nanoporous electrode array in recording unit and burst activity from hippocampal slice cultures. 

Recently, the lab has demonstrated that nanoporous gold is biocompatible and can deliver drugs for modulating cellular response. The findings were published and featured as the cover story of Advance Healthcare Material 2012 March issue. 

The Advantage of nanoporous gold electrode arrays: 

(i)	Address bottlenecks in existing technologies (e.g., cost, repeatability, delamination, scalability); 
(ii)	Exhibit very low electrolyte-electrode impedance due to its high surface area-to-volume ratio, thus enhances signal-to-noise ration in electrophysiological recordings; 
(iii)	Enable streamlined integration with electronics with the use of conventional microfabrication technology; and
(iv)	 Release drug molecules in situ from the nanoporous core to modulate biological response (e.g., reduce adverse tissue reaction to electrodes). 

The primary area of use is neural electrophysiological applications, including planar multiple electrode arrays for in vitro studies (e.g., neurotoxin or drug screening using cultured neuronal networks) and implantable electrodes for fundamental studies as well as clinical studies (e.g., brain-machine interfaces, deep brain stimulation).

The memory is based on ferrooxide material coated inorganic semiconductor nanowires, such as barium titanate coated silicon.  The nanowire is used to make a field-effect transistor (FET) composed of the nanowire core in ohmic contact with the source, and drain electrodes and a gate in contact with the ferrooxide coating, similar to an industry standard MRIS planar FET.  The memory has been demonstrated to hold information for at least a week and is expected, with optimization, to hold data for years.  The new memory combines the speed of DRAM with the non-volatility of flash memory and low-power consumption of SRAM, and could be the basis of memories needed for future mobile electronic devices.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:A great advantage of the nanowire-based FET of the invention over the prior art planar FET is that it can store many bits of data because many top gates can be placed in contact with the ferrooxide coating, each such gated portion of the nanowire being capable of storing a bit.  These gates can, in theory, be within 2.4 nm of each other, resulting in a super dense memory."," Materials  |   Microelectronics  |   Materials  |   Microelectronics","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=2422","Mick Sawka, (617) 496-3830","Harvard University"

These biomaterials, which are usually made of either biological polymers such as alginate or synthetic polymers such as poly(lactic acid) (PLA), help cells organize into functioning tissues, but poor conductivity of these materials limits the ability of the patch to contract strongly as a unit. Children's researchers showed that incorporating gold nanowires within alginate scaffolds can bridge the electrically resistant pore walls of alginate and improve electrical communication between adjacent cardiac cells. ||

The figure shows a schematic overview of three-dimensional cardiac tissue (a): Isolated cardiomyocytes are cultured in either pristine alginate or Alg-NW composites. Insets highlight the components of the engineered tissue (cardiac cells - red, alginate pore walls - blue and gold nanowires - yellow). ||

Whereas cardiomyocytes in pristine alginate scaffolds (b, top) typically form only small clusters that beat asynchronously and with random polarization, Alg-NW scaffolds (b, bottom) can exhibit synchronization across scaffold walls, throughout the entire scaffold. ||

Cardiomyocytes cultured in alginate scaffolds (c, top) form small beating clusters, but synchronously beating cardiomyocytes in Alg-NW composites (c, bottom) have the potential to form organized cardiac-like tissue. (Colors, contour lines and arrows represent the spatial and temporal evolution of the signal maximum.) ||

Tissues grown on these composite matrices were thicker and better aligned than those grown on pristine alginate and when electrically stimulated, the cells in these tissues contracted synchronously. Also, higher levels of the proteins involved in muscle contraction and electrical coupling are detected in the composite matrices."," Medical Devices  |   Medical Devices","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=2135","Khunkhun, Rajinder, rajinder.khunkhun@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"

It has been found that approximately 20% of all new HIV-1 infections are resistant to the currently available drugs.  Consequently, concerted efforts toward the discovery and development of novel inhibitors of HIV-1 infection and replication must persist if continued viral repression and virus eradication are to be achieved.  Products derived from natural sources have been shown to inhibit HIV-1 replication during various stages of the virus life cycle and represent a potential source of novel therapeutic agents.  
     Potential Commercial Uses: The methods and compositions, of the invention feature a natural product extract, or purified components thereof, for the treatment of HIV-1 and other viral infections.  The natural products of the invention include brown algae, specifically algae of the Sargassum fusiforme species. The inventors have shown that aqueous extracts from S. fusiforme blocked HIV-1 infection and replication by over 90% in T cells, human macrophages and microglia, and also inhibited pseudotyped HIV-1 (VSV/NL4-3) infection in human astrocytes by over 70%. Inhibition was mediated against both CXCR4 (X4) and CCR5 (R5)-tropic HIV-1, was dose dependent and long lasting, did not inhibit cell growth or viability, was not toxic to cells, and was comparable to inhibition by the nucleoside analogue 2', 3'-didoxycytidine (ddC). S. fusiforme treatment blocked direct cell-to-cell infection spread. The inventors have begun to characterize the active components of these extracts, and have identified specific compounds which appear to have antiviral activity.

The current antibacterial fibers are composed of a natural polymer derived from crab shells and a cinnamon extract. These materials can conform to any surface and are desirable in biomedical, environmental, and industrial applications. 

UMass Amherst researchers utilize the electrospinning process to generate novel non-woven chitosan- poly(ethylene oxide) nanofiber mats that deliver active agents. In the first instance, cinnamaldehyde, a non-toxic, antimicrobial, and anticorrosive agent derived from cinnamon bark has been attached to chitosan. Chitosan, an abundant biopolymer found primarily in crustascean shells provides hypoallergenic, antimicrobial, and hemostatic properties. The U.S. and Europe has already approved of chitosan for use in commercial bandages. Materials composed of chitosan-cinnamaldehyde conjugates have already been proven effective against the gram negative bacteria, Escherichi coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These promising results suggest these nanofibers may have utility in wound care products and other flexible materials for biomedical applications. Moreover, this platform technology can be employed to generate materials with a range of antimicrobial or other beneficial properties by conjugating other essential oils (e.g. vanillin, thymol, eugenol) or small molecules (e.g. sugars, fragrances, vitamins)."," Biomaterials and Diagnostics/Biomarkers","http://www.umass.edu/research/available-technologies/natural-polymer-nanofiber-mats-enhanced-antimicrobial-properties","Office of Commercial Ventures and Intellectual Property Phone: 413-545-3606   E-Mail: cvip@research.umass.edu","University of Massachusetts at  Amherst"
"3599","Licensable Technology","Naturally occurring molecule serves as a novel adjuvant to boost immune responses","von Andrian, Ulrich H.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Immunostimulation: The previously unknown role for this naturally occurring molecule may be used to develop a novel vaccine adjuvant to strongly stimulate immune responses. Induction of antigen specific tolerance: Immunosuppressive agents are commonly used in a variety of clinical settings, leading to broad therapeutic opportunities for this technology.  Immunosuppression is a crucial part of many medical procedures such as transplantation, and is used to treat a range of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and lupus.The majority of approved immunosuppressive agents act non-specifically to inhibit immune inflammatory activity.  Not only do these drugs produce numerous side effects, they are only partially effective in inhibiting self-reactive immune cell function.  Antigen-specific therapies may offer significant advantages by selectively blocking the effects of self-reactive immune cell function, while maintaining the ability of the immune system to remove non-self antigens.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Dendritic cells (DCs) are a type of immune cell that capture antigens in peripheral tissues and travel to the local lymph nodes where they activate antigen-specific T- and B-cells by presenting the antigens on their surfaces.  Once activated, naïve CD4+ T-cells proliferate and can differentiate into effector T-cells and memory T-cells which usually exert immune functions that lead to the elimination of the offending antigen.  Alternatively, CD4+ T-cells can differentiate into regulatory T-cells (Treg) which suppress the activity of other immune cells in order to maintain immune homeostasis and tolerance to self-antigens.  One class of Tregs, naturally occurring Tregs (nTreg), arises in the thymus and is characterized by the co-expression of Foxp3 transcription factor and IL-2 receptor alpha chain (CD25).  Adaptive Tregs (aTregs) can also arise in non-inflammatory situations by conversion of conventional CD4+ T-cells, which suppress responses to common antigens, such as food or harmless components of the environment.  The von Andrian laboratory demonstrated that a naturally occurring molecule can serve as a novel adjuvant to boost immune responses, a role previously unknown for this molecule.  Further, inhibition of a specific receptor for this molecule, as well as other key factors in that receptor's signaling pathway, can induce tolerogenic DC that convert conventional CD4+ T-cells to aTregs and promote antigen specific tolerance.  •     Immunostimulation using novel adjuvantThe lab identified a naturally occurring molecule that can serve as an adjuvant to boost the immunostimulatory function of DC.  DCs treated with this molecule induced more robust T-cell proliferation than adjuvants that act on Toll-like receptors, such as LPS and CpG.  This molecule may therefore be used to develop a novel adjuvant for the induction of strong immune responses.•     Induction of tolerogenic DC and antigen specific toleranceo     Induction of tolerogenic DC: Inhibition of a DC-expressed receptor for this naturally occurring molecule significantly boosts the tolerogenic capacity of DC. Researchers treated DCs with an inhibitor of the molecule’s signaling pathway, and then cultured them with naïve CD4+ T-cells.  This treatment induced the differentiation of Foxp3-expressing aTregs more robustly than DCs treated with other cocktails known to induce Foxp3 expression.  Blocking this pathway may therefore be effective in suppressing immune responses.o     Induction of antigen specific tolerance: Researchers in the lab also discovered novel methods of transforming naïve human CD4+ T-cells into aTregs.  Although aTregs have been extensively characterized in rodents, it was previously impossible to artificially induce them in humans using naïve T cells as precursors.  DCs treated with key factors and cultured with naïve CD4+ T-cells produced aTregs that expressed molecular markers characteristic of the naturally occurring Tregs, such as Foxp3 and CD25.  They further demonstrated in vivo activity of the artificially induced tolerogenic DCs.  DCs treated with these key factors were injected into mice suffering from Experimental Allergic Encephalomyelitis, a model of brain inflammation, and shown to not only block the progression of the disease but also reverse existing neuropathology."," ","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3599","Michal Preminger, (617) 432-0920","Harvard University"
"514","Licensable Technology","NBS-1 Antibody Proteins, NBS-1 Antibodies","Kaelin, W","p53 is the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor protein identified in human cancers. The ability of p53 to negatively regulate cell growth is due, in part, to its ability to bind to specific DNA sequences and activate the transcription of certain target genes. The gene NBS-1 (also called p73) encodes a protein having a deduced amino acid sequence showing varying levels of homology to certain p53 domains.
Our method allows normal human B cells to be obtained from peripheral blood, expanded in vitro in presence of immune suppressors to differentially suppress the growth of T cells and activated using CD40 ligand.  The cultures are stable over long periods (at least 6 months) and can be cryopreserved.  These cells are as efficient as dendritic cells for presenting antigen and are fully functional even in the presence of immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-beta.  We additionally have developed a stable CD40L transfectant cell line that cal be used as a source of CD40L for activating the B cells in this protocol.

Applications/Advantages: Treatment of a subject having a p53 dependent tumor by determining the level of NBS-1 in the tumor cells, and comparing it to a corresponding non-malignant (normal) cell. If the level of NBS-1 in the tumor cell is not elevated, one can increase the level of NBS-1 in that cell. An alternative is to compare the NBS-1 level with the p53 level in the tumor cell. If the NBS-1 level is 10% or less, one can elevate the NBS-1 level."," Research Reagents","http://www.dfci.harvard.edu/res/technology/available.asp?case_number=514&keywords=&category_id=3&category_name=Research+Reagents","Ojas Mehta, Phone (617) 632-5807, Fax (617) 632-4012, Email Ojas_Mehta@dfci.harvard.edu","Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"

The resulting cells, known as induced pluripotent (iPS) cells, are widely viewed as being potentially valuable both as research tools and for possible therapeutic purposes because they are expected to be more widely available than human embryonic stem cells, with fewer of the ethical issues affecting embryonic cells. McLean investigators, working with the Jaenisch laboratory at the Whitehead Institute of MIT, have demonstrated that iPS cells can be differentiated into neural stem cells, which can be used to treat symptoms of Parkinson's Disease (PD) in animal models. The investigators created iPS cells from fibroblasts and then induced them to differentiate into neural precursor cells. When grafted into the brains of rats experimentally induced to exhibit PD-like symptoms the transplanted cells were found to have extended into the surrounding brain tissue and were able to improve the PD-like symptoms.
     Potential Commercial Uses: These ""proof-of-concept"" animal studies lay the groundwork for the use of stem cell therapies, particularly those relying on iPS cells, for the treatment of humans afflicted with disorders such as PD. The invention enables adult cells harvested from skin or other non-neuronal tissue, to be easily and reliably reprogrammed to become neuronal precursor cells that can be used in cell therapy approaches for treatment or prevention of PD. Such methods can make use of autologous transplants using a patient's own cells, or eventually a standardized product for heterologous transplants. This invention will lead to safer, more specific, and more powerful treatments for PD, which would be of great importance given the prevalence of this disease in our aging populations. Current therapy for PD, such as the pharmacological use of the dopamine precursor L-DOPA to replace brain dopamine, has had only limited effectiveness and will produce side-effects for patients

The business opportunity now exists to exploit this scientific discovery to develop improved therapeutics for neurodegenerative and neurological diseases.Overview:Trypanosoma cruzi, a protozoan parasite that causes Chagas' disease, expresses a membrane-bound and shed neuraminidase that, independently of catalytic activity, promotes differentiation and survival of growth factor-deprived neuronal and glial cells in synergy with the neurocytokines ciliary neurotrophic factor and leukemia inhibitory factor.  This neuraminidase also triggers endothelial cells to secrete interleukin-6, a cytokine with neurotrophic activity. Recent studies gained further insights into the neuroprotective role of this parasite-derived mimic of neurotrophic factors (PDNF) by investigating whether PDNF can reproduce the actions of conventional growth factors in a cellular model of neurodegenerative diseases. In these studies PDNF was shown to rescue human and rat dopaminergic neuronal cells exposed to the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and its toxic metabolite, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), both widely used to generate cellular and animal models of neurodegenerative Parkinson's disease.  PDNF prevented MPTP-induced cell death at concentrations comparable to those of nerve growth factor and insulin-like growth factor-1, in a MAPK/Erk activation-dependent manner.  Given that MPTP causes dopaminergic cell death in part by upregulating mediators of apoptosis such as oxygen radicals and caspases, it was remarkable to find that PDNF strongly suppressed the production of superoxide anion and other reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the activation not only of initiator caspase-9 but also of effector caspase-3.  This down-regulation of ROS and caspases explain, at least in part, the PDNF-induced salvaging of the dopaminergic cells from the Parkinsonism-promoting toxin. Applications:These findings raise the exciting prospect for PDNF's novel therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative and neurological diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Chagas' disease, peripheral neuropathy, palsies, multiple sclerosis, stroke, brain trauma, spinal cord trauma and peripheral nerve trauma."," ","http://www.tufts.biz/cgi-bin/tech_search.cgi?r=1&case=T000724","John Cosmopoulos617-636-0366john.cosmopoulos@tufts.edu","Tufts University"

They are used in electromechanical systems, smart devices, and scientific instruments in medicine, biotechnology, information technology, space, manufacturing, military, microtechnology, and nanotechnology.  As these systems, devices, and instruments decrease in size, actuators must also shrink, consume less power, and cost less.  At the same time, they must generate more power and be easy to make. Drs. Kyu-Jin Cho, Elliot Wright Hawkes, and Robert J. Wood have developed an actuator that meets these new criteria.  The basis of their new actuator is a new system for annealing shape memory alloys (SMAs). These SMAs are small and precise, allowing the actuators they form to be smaller and more precise, as well as scalable, inexpensive, and powerful. These SMA actuators can be used in these areas: •     Autonomous and controlled in vivo diagnostic devices that are equipped with video and other sensors•     Small, unmanned aquatic sensing devices for homeland security applications •     Environmental monitoringINNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:The SMA actuator is a millimeter scale actuator that can generate motion.

"3198","Licensable Technology","New cell sorting technology could replace fluorescent and magnetic technologies","Prentiss, Mara G.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Throughout the biological, medical, and pharmaceutical fields, cell sorting is used for research and some clinical practices. In research, cell sorting is already used to count, characterize, and analyze living cells and their particles. In clinical practices, it is mostly reserved for diagnostics. Cell sorting could be used much more extensively, but the existing technologies, fluorescently activated cell sorting (FACS™) and magnetically activated cell sorting (MACS®), are expensive. Usually, cell sorting equipment is limited to a single lab within a large institution, such as a university, and that lab sorts cells for other researchers and clinicians. Dr. Prentiss’ team developed a new cell sorting technology that could dramatically expand the availability of cell sorting equipment, and thereby the use of cell sorting. The new process is orders of magnitude faster, better, and less expensive than FACS and MACS. If cell sorting cell equipment could become more commonly available, it could be make many applications such as these more available and viable: •     Biological research – Identify and characterize cells and cell populations in complex systems in molecular biology, protein engineering, plant biology, and marine biology; and prepare pure sources of stem cells.  •     Medical diagnostics – Determine if there are cancer cells in a patient’s system (to head off cancer metastasis); precisely diagnose leukemia and lymphomas using blood plasma samples instead of bone marrow tests; analyze tissue specimens from patients; and analyze human DNA and determine if there are risks for hereditary diseases. •     Clinical practice – Develop sources of purified cells to treat neurological degenerative disease through transplantation; improve understanding of tumor immunology and treatment by evaluating pure samples of tumor cells; and rescue healthy cells and re-introduce them into patients undergoing chemotherapy to reduce the side effects of chemotherapeutics. •     Drug discovery – Isolate and grow living tissue for drug experimentation.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Dr. Prentiss’ lab has developed a new cell sorting technology based on microfluidics. This technique enables manipulation of non-magnetic micro- and nano-entities, including cells, immersed in magnetic fluids. Compared to existing MACS and FACS cell sorters, this technique uses simple equipment that is significantly and measurable faster, cheaper, and easier to use than MACS and FACS cell sorters. MACS cell sorting relies on magnetic tagging of antigens on cells. When the cell mixture is passed through a strong magnetic field, the cells expressing the antigens are captured and the other cells are released. FACS cell sorting uses multiple lasers to detect and measure the different light scattering and fluorescent characteristics of cells, one-by-one, and then physically separates the cells based on the cells fluorescent measurement. Dr. Prentiss’ technique uses magnetic fields to separate cells, greatly simplifying the cell sorting process and equipment required to support it. In addition to simplifying the process, this new technology speeds up cell sorting rates. FACS can sort cells in speeds ranging from 10,000 cells per second up to about 50,000 cells per second (depending on cell suspension, cell size, and other factors); whereas MACS can sort cells up to speeds of 10 million cells per second.   Because the new non-magnetic cell sorting technology is based on microfluidics, it can be easily and cost-effectively scaled to process billions of cells per second."," Fluidics/Microfluidics","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3198","Sam Liss, (617) 495-4371","Harvard University"

It allows for optical manipulations such as color (frequency of light waves), brightness (amplitude) and polarization of light to create a “funhouse mirror” type effect using flat surfaces in ways never before thought possible. Applications are seen in the full spectrum of optical devices including consumer electronics, laboratory equipment and communications.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Present optical components rely on gradual phase shifts accumulated during light propagation to shape optical wavefronts. This includes diffractive optical components such as phase-shift masks, spatial lightwave modulators and holograms, in addition to bulk optical components, such as lenses. In phase-shift masks, widely used to improve image resolution in photolithography, wavefront of propagating light is modified by introducing spatially dependent phase shifts. In spatial light modulators the wavefront can be dynamically modified by tuning pixelated liquid crystal cells. New degrees of freedom in optical design can be attained by introducing in the optical path phase discontinuities over the scale of the wavelength using arrays of plasmonic antennas. Such an array of suitably designed optical antennas with spatially varying phase and amplitude response can imprint an arbitrary distribution of phase discontinuities on the propagating wavefront allowing unprecedented degrees of freedom in optical design and beam shaping. A new class of components based on this principle is proposed: planar lenses, wave plates, blazed gratings, spiral phase plates, and other elements across the visible, infrared, and terahertz spectral ranges."," Photonics/Optical Systems","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=4239","Alan Gordon, (617) 384-5000","Harvard University"

There is therefore a need for effective devices and methods for delivering physiologically useful compounds to any desired site of action in a controlled fashion.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Harvard's researchers have developed a new device for protein and gene delivery. It makes use of the unique ability of unicellular organism protozoa to infect a host, evade their immune defense, and target specific tissues.Protozoa are single-celled, independently living eukaryotic organisms. Some of these species are pathogenic while others have no detectable adverse effects or pathologies. Protozoa spread from one host to another through a variety of methods. In the United States, approximately half of the population is infected with the species of Toxoplasma, primarily through direct physical contact with the domestic cat. Entamoeba, which live in the human gut, are transmitted through drinking water. Other protozoa, such as the malaria Plasmodium and Leishmania, are transmitted via insect vectors.With this technology, the genome of Leishmania can be altered to lack a naturally-occurring nucleotide sequence responsible for a selectable phenotype. Additionally, their genome can encode an expression product for sustained delivery. The expression product is typically a hormone, enzyme or neurotransmitter. Additional levels of control on protozoa can be accomplished with the use of antimicrobials and suicide genes. It is therefore possible for the clinician to control or even to completely eliminate the therapeutic protozoa from the patient."," Therapeutics - Methods  |   Vaccines","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=1329","Grant Zimmermann, (617) 495-3067","Harvard University"

However, available manufacturing technologies in MEMS and conventional machining lack the versatility, precision, and cost-efficiency to produce large quantities of functional devices on this scale. The present invention addresses this need through a series of process innovations which enable the monolithic fabrication of functional, three-dimensional mechanisms from a superplanar stack of precisely patterned material layers.

HSV infection typically results in lifelong latent infection that periodically give rise to clinical outbreaks, expressed as lesions, as well as by a highly contagious period. To date, existing therapies, like Acyclovir, are aimed at reducing the symptoms of outbreaks, but do not offer definite cure. Researchers at the Knipe lab have identified a new drug target for Herpes viruses that may provide another option for first line therapy, and a synergistic effect to drugs that are currently in use.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:The Knipe laboratory identified conserved residues in HSV-1 ICP8 that share structural homology with cellular enzymes in the DDE family. They provide evidence that these residues are required for HSV-1 DNA recombination and that recombination of the viral genome is required for viral DNA replication.  Their findings demonstrate that inhibition of virally encoded DDE recombinases can be effectively exploited as a target for antiviral drugs. Identifying ICP8 as a new drug target for double stranded DNA viral infections opens the door for a gamut of therapeutic developments: While HSV infection is often treated with Acyclovir, There is a clear need for a new anti- HSV drug due to the growing presence of Acyclovir resistant HSV strains. Therefore, the discovery that HIV integrase inhibitors can also inhibit HSV replication has a potential to fill this immediate and significant medical need.HIV Integrase inhibitors that are used for the treatment of HIV were shown by researchers in the Knipe lab to also inhibit HSV-1 replication in cell based assays with high efficacy. This discovery provides evidence that one drug treatment has the ability to treat both HIV and HSV infections. Especially when considering the fact that HSV infection is a well characterized risk factor for HIV acquisition and transmission.Targeting ICP8 as a new target for drugs could provide a synergistic effect with other polymerase inhibitors which are currently the primary choice in the market, such as Acyclovir.Finally, ICP8 homolog was found also in other herpes viruses, opening the door to treat more disease oriented indications like CMV and EBV in the future."," Therapeutics - Drugs","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=4214","Michal Preminger, (617) 432-0920","Harvard University"

This invention has the potential to revolutionize treatment of these autoimmune diseases by specifically inhibiting the part of the immune response causing the disease while avoiding effects on other arms of the immune system. Diseases arising from antibodies to self proteins (auto-antibodies) such as myasthenia gravis and recurrent forms of Graves’ disease are particularly good candidates for this therapy, as well as other autoimmune diseases with humoral immune components such as lupus, multiple sclerosis, graft-vs.-host-disease, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune hepatitis, and juvenile dermatomyositis.Amplified TFR populations can be transplanted to target specific antibodiesTFR cells can be amplified in culture and transplanted to patients to suppress antibody production. They can be used in personalized therapy by extracting them from patients, selecting those that mediate the specific autoimmune response, amplifying and resupplying them to the patient. Antibodies to specific therapeutic proteins can be suppressed or enhancedA major complication in gene therapy is antibodies against the gene product being replaced. And in hemophilia, 25% of patients develop antibodies to platelet proteins during replacement therapy. This invention can be used to specifically suppress those responses.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:A recently-discovered class of T cells - T follicular regulatory (TFR) cells - controls the production of antibodies. TFR cells inhibit T follicular helper (TFH) cells, which mediate antibody production in lymph nodes. Several autoimmune diseases are caused by inappropriate antibodies, including lupus and myasthenia gravis, and accordingly TFH cells are up regulated in these diseases. However, until now there has been no way of controlling the production of antibodies to specific antigens through T cell regulatory pathways. The Sharpe Laboratory has found a target on TFR cells (the surface receptor PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1) that when suppressed, increases the number of TFR cells, which they show selectively reduces antibody levels in vivo (HU Case 3723). They have also shown that transplanting populations of TFR can cause similar effects. Most importantly, they have shown that TFR cells selectively suppress humoral immune responses, but do not inhibit other arms of the immune system.TFR cells circulate in the blood, home to lymph nodes, and inhibit antibody production there. The Sharpe Lab has found for the first time that TFR cells circulate in the blood of mice, move to the germinal centers in lymph nodes, and inhibit the antibody-producing B cell response there. They transferred blood TFR cells from mice challenged with an antigen into mice completely lacking their own TFR cells.  In the recipient mice, the transferred TFR cells not only move from the blood to the lymph nodes, but potently inhibit the production of IgG specific to the antigen challenge in the donor."," Therapeutics - Methods","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=4696","Michal Preminger, (617) 432-0920","Harvard University"
"3696","Licensable Technology","New therapeutic targets for the treatment of asthma and COPD","Lu, Quan","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Beta 2-adrenergic receptor (B2AR) agonists are sympathomimetic agents that stimulate bronchodilation. Both short-acting and long-acting B2AR agonists have been used for many years in the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although B2AR undergoes internalization upon binding of its agonists (desensitization), under normal conditions most internalized B2AR is rapidly and efficiently recycled back to the cell surface (resensitization), with very little undergoing lysosomal degradation. However, prolonged stimulation of B2AR leads to receptor ubiquitination and subsequent redirection of internalized B2ARs from recycling to degradation, a process that may limit the efficacy of long term beta 2-agonist treatment.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Using a novel genome-wide EST-derived shRNA library screen, Harvard University researchers in the laboratory of Professor Quan Lu have identified more than a dozen targets whose inhibition results in reduction of agonist-induced B2AR degradation. To facilitate a FACS-based high-throughput genetic screening strategy, the investigators used a HEK293 cell line that expresses a distally truncated form of human B2AR (293.B2ARt) known to be deficient in its ability to recycle to the surface following agonist-induced internalization. To confirm that the inhibitory effect of the shRNAs on agonist induced B2AR internalization was specifically due to knockdown of genes coded by the shRNAs, synthetic siRNAs against the same candidate target genes, but with different sequences from the shRNAs, were tested in both 293.B2ARt and cells expressing unmodified B2AR (293.B2ARWT).One of the targets identified is farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDPS), the pharmaceutical target of the bisphosphonates that are widely used to treat osteoporosis. In 293.B2ARt cells, alendronate induced a dose dependent increase of cell surface B2AR after induction with the agonist isoproterenol. When tested in 293.B2ARWT cells, an increase in cell surface B2AR was seen both before and after agonist induction. These results were further generalized to human primary airway smooth muscle cells, in which inactivation of FDPS was shown to have a similar effect on B2AR surface levels.These discoveries highlight the possible utility of treating asthma and COPD with a combination of a B2AR agonist and a modulator of agonist-induced B2AR degradation."," Drug Discovery Tools  |   Therapeutics - Drugs  |   Therapeutics - Methods","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3696","Grant Zimmermann, (617) 495-3067","Harvard University"

Proteonomics of Isolated Proteins (PiCh) and Capture Hybridization analysis of RNA targers (CHART) are two related technologies developed in the laboratories of Robert Kingston to allow scientists answer the question ""which proteins or long-non coding RNAs are bound to, or located in complexes of this stretch of DNA??

First introduced in 2009, PICh uses tagged sequence-specific DNA probes to capture and purify cross-linked DNA-bound protein complexes prior to the identification by Mass Spectrometry. While PICh is complementary to other methods such as chromatin Immunoprecipitation, PiCh clearly distinguishes from these because it relies on the DNA sequence of the target chromosal and does not require prior knowledge or the protein.  PiChs concept was demonstrated in mammalian cells and can be applied to a wide range of organisms

CHART is a further development of the PiCh technology and allows the study of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and determine where lncRNAs bind to the chromatin. CHART was used to enrich DNA and protein targets of endogenous lncRNAs from flies and humans. CHART generates genomic binding profiles of lncRNAs in chromatin with high resolution to understand the functionality of lncRNAs, including their roles regulating chromatin structure and gene expression.

Advantages: 
PiCh and CHART has utility in a broad range of biological research areas.

Technology:  The inventors have developed a novel, non-invasive Two-Dimensional Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (2D MRS) methodology.  Through the use of this 2D MRS methodology, the inventors have identified cerebral metabolites (not identifiable through conventional spectroscopy) and demonstrated them to be indicative of repetitive head injury (also known as mild traumatic brain injury, mTBI) such as diffuse neuronal/axonal injury and neurotransmitter dysfunction, which can ultimately lead to fatal Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE).  


Applications:  2D MRS monitoring of athletes (from child athletes to professionals), soldiers, or any other subject who may sustain impacts to the head and are thereby at risk for mTBI.
  
	
Advantage:	Currently, CTE can only be diagnosed post mortem; this technology enables diagnosis and monitoring of living subjects suspected of having mTBI.  CTE may be avoided if mTBI can be identified in its beginning stages and future head impacts can be avoided for a period of time.

The impact of MDD spans from decreased quality of life to economic costs from health care expenditures and from lowered productivity to increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Clinical diagnosis and monitoring of MDD and its therapy are currently based exclusively on subjective criteria, such as the Hamilton scoring index.  The search for objective, reliable biomarkers of MDD remains a central challenge in contemporary medicine. The method presented herein represents the first physiological means by which MDD can be diagnosed.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:This method takes advantage of the fact that MDD alters the complexity of a number of physiologic output signals. These signals include the heartbeat time series obtained from a continuous electrocardiogram during sleeping hours, the changes in the local energy of voice dynamics and the changes in sleep stage fluctuations. In all three contexts, MDD lowers the degree of complexity of these signals, as measured using multiscale entropy (MSE) and related techniques that probe the information content of a signal across multiple time scales. This approach will serve as the basis of making the diagnosis of MDD, of tracking its response to therapy and of evaluating therapeutic interventions, both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic. This technology represents a major step forward in the diagnosis of MDD and is likely to correct a broader swath of patients who may not be willing to receive behavioral exams.

Current adjuvants in the market (i.e., alum) are effective inducing humoral immune response by boosting antibody production but are less efficient at modulating innate immunity necessary to eradicate infections. || 

Dr. Kagan’s group identified and characterized a novel fatty adjuvant oxPAPC that is able to promote dendritic cell survival and the release of cytokine interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß) that triggers memory T-cell production. When oxPAPC is administered subcutaneously to mice, the dendritic cells enter a “hyperactivation state” and show a 5-fold increase in adaptive immunity. Another of their key findings is that oxPAPC acts via caspase-11 to promote hyperactivation of dendritic cells. ||

Notably, oxPAPC is unique among known adjuvants in its ability to stimulate dendritic cells specifically, not macrophages. Both of these cell types are stimulated by all other adjuvants on the market, with macrophages being the major source of painful inflammation during vaccination, oxPAPC may facilitate the development of vaccines with less reactogenicity."," Research Tools  |   Therapeutics - Drugs","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=2805","Meyer, Abbie, abbie.meyer@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"
"CCMC   2200","Licensable Technology","Novel age-specific vaccine testing platform","Levy, Ofer","Vaccines provide safe and effective protection from a multitude of infectious diseases. However, the need for the development of new vaccines persists. This need is most prevalent in neonates and infants whose lack of vaccination leaves them prone to deadly infections. Newly developed vaccines suffer from a low success rate in clinical trials because of preclinical testing conducted on models that provide inaccurate predictions of human immune responses. ||

Drs. Schmitz and Levy have developed an effective method to model neonatal vaccine responses through the use of an in vitro microphysiologic tissue construct. This novel platform is capable of allowing analyses with human primary, untouched materials instead of animal models. It is designed to use age-specific monocytes to add greater specificity to the model. All of these factors culminate to provide researchers with a better understanding of a vaccine’s impact in neonates and beyond. The effects of adjuvant and vaccine candidates can be readily and more thoroughly tested with this technology, helping to evaluate them at a lower cost. ||

Testing of this technology was confirmed using well-known and routinely prescribed newborn vaccines resulting in the production of active antigen-presenting cells and cytokine secretion patterns which are confirmed with in vivo occurrences."," Therapeutics - Drugs  |   Vaccines  |   Therapeutics - Drugs","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=2200","Meyer, Abbie, abbie.meyer@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"

However, the supply of RBCs is completely dependent upon the frequency and quality of blood donations, and blood banks are often in short supply. The ability to produce RBCs ex vivo from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) or pluripotent stem cells is a major area of research focused on providing a more reliable alternative to our volatile blood supply.  ||

The lab of Vijay Sankaran at Boston Children’s has developed a new method to boost the efficiency of ex vivo production of RBCs. By silencing the gene SH2B3, the researchers were able to boost RBC production from adult HSPCs and cord blood HSPCs by 2- to 7- fold. In addition, deleting SH2B3 in human pluripotent stem cells increased the yield of erythroid cells by 3-fold. ||

To achieve this result, the researchers used large-scale population genetics to identify that rare loss-of-function versions of the SH2B3 gene are linked to increased RBC counts in humans. The lab used two independent gene silencing techniques, shRNA and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, and found that knockdown of SH2B3 led to increased differentiation of HSPCs into mature RBCs ex vivo. These findings demonstrate the principle that stable knockdown of SH2B3 can provide an improved method for generating RBCs."," Research Tools  |   Research Tools  |   Research Tools","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=2797","Meyer, Abbie, abbie.meyer@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"

The resulting catalyst is virtually free of microcrystalline metal particles and just as efficient as traditional catalysts.BackgroundFuel cells produce energy in the form of electricity through the conversion of hydrogen fuel and oxygen to water.  Reformate gas produced by fuel cells generally includes hydrogen (H2), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), water (H2O) and small quantities of methane (CH4).  It is necessary to completely remove the CO component.  CO poisons the anode catalyst, degrading fuel cell performance, and constitutes a criterion pollutant.CO is eliminated through the low-temperature water-gas shift (LTS) reaction (CO + H2O <---> CO2 + H2).  It converts carbon monoxide with water vapor to carbon dioxide and hydrogen.  Gold and platinum nanoparticles are used to catalyze the reaction.  Current research indicates that LTS catalysts based on cerium oxide (ceria) hold great promise.  Only a minute quantity of gold or platinum in non-metallic form (a loading of 1-10 wt%) is needed to create an active catalyst.  The current invention demonstrates that stripping this precious metal of most of its metallic crystalline structure with a cyanide solution still exhibits normal catalytic activity.  This discovery demonstrates that the amount of precious metal needed for catalysis may be reduced by up to 90%.Advantages and ApplicationsThe current invention describes methods to remove the majority of the metallic constituents on catalytic substrates.  The removal does not compromise the catalytic nature of the material and offers substantial reductions in manufacturing costs.Fuel cells have a wide range of environmentally friendly applications and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels for energy.

"T001482","Licensable Technology","Novel Cholera Vaccine","Andrew Camilli","Tufts University Categories:therapeutic:vaccineAdditional Keywords:choleraInvention SummaryCHOLERA VACCINEOpportunityCholera remains a persistent threat in the developing world, where clean drinking water is scarce.  Due to lack of access to adequate medical facilities and the epidemic nature of the disease, a cholera vaccine is the most viable option for dealing with the disease in endemic areas.  However, current vaccine formulations are ineffective as they are too expensive and complicated to reach those most affected by the disease.  Researchers at Tufts University School of Medicine have developed a novel cholera vaccine comprised of outer membrane vesicles from the causative agent, Vibrio cholerae.  This new vaccine is stable at ambient temperatures and thus has the potential to be less expensive and more effective than current cholera vaccines, which would allow increased distribution to those in need. BackgroundCholera is a potentially fatal diarrheal disease endemic to many areas, including some of the most impoverished in the world.  The disease is acquired by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio cholerae.  Although cholera is often preventable and treatable, it is responsible for many deaths worldwide and prone to severe outbreaks due to lack of access to adequate medical facilities/treatments.  It is for this reason that the World Health Organization recommends that cholera vaccines be used in endemic areas to prevent/control outbreaks.  However, existing cholera vaccines are too expensive for many endemic countries and also require temperature-controlled distribution systems, which both complicate and increase the cost of distribution.  Thus, cholera vaccines often do not reach those who would benefit most from such protection.InventionRecent work at Tufts University School of Medicine by Dr. Andrew Camilli has led to the development of a novel cholera vaccine comprised of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) from V. cholerae.  OMVs are spherical blebs naturally shed by Gram-negative bacteria and are composed of a lipid bilayer containing outer membrane proteins and other periplasmic components.  Some proteins found in OMVs from pathogenic bacteria include toxins, adhesins, and immunomoulatory compounds.  OMVs provide a means by which bacteria can interact with other cells in their environment.  Because OMVs are naturally produced during growth in broth culture, they can be easily collected in standard laboratory conditions.  Additionally, OMVs are stable at ambient temperatures and therefore do not require special storage conditions.Experiments have shown that immunization of adult mice with OMVs leads to the production of antibodies specific to V. cholerae proteins.  Additionally, immunization of pregnant dams confers protective immunity to their offspring even when challenged with infectious doses 100-fold higher than the ID50.  This protection can extend long term as pups born 84 days post-immunization were still protected from infection.   OMV vaccines can be delivered via multiple methods including the intranasal, intragastric, or intraperitoneal routes, with similar efficacy.  Also, it is possible to create a multivalent vaccine using V. cholerae OMVs, as heterologous antigens expressed in V. cholerae can be naturally loaded into OMVs, Advantages:This technology provides the following significant improvements over previous cholera vaccines:-OMVs are stable at ambient temperatures, thus temperature-controlled storage is not necessary.-An OMV-based vaccine can be administered by many methods, including the intranasal route, which may obviate potential side effects and allow for easier distribution.  -V. cholerae OMVs can be loaded with heterlogous antigens, thus using the same technology to produce vaccines against additional pathogens.  -Vaccination of a pregnant female confers protective immunity to the offspring of that individual.-A V. cholerae OMV vaccine has the potential to be less expensive and more effective than current cholera vaccine formulations, which would allow increased distribution to those in need.

The novel imaging probes can be used to image BAT mass, BAT activity, and browning (BAT-like changes) in WAT without pretreatment activation using near infrared (NIR)/fluorescent imaging or PET.

Application:
The imaging probes can be used to image BAT mass, BAT activity, or WAT browning in mammals. The probes can also be used to monitor the effects of anti-obesity and diabetes treatment related to BAT. Either PET or NIR fluorescent imaging can be used with these compounds, offering applications in small animals or humans.

Advantages:
- BAT and browning of WAT can be imaged without pretreatment activation.
- Imaging probes can be used to image BAT mass as well as BAT activation.
- Probes can be used with NIR/fluorescent or PET imaging, providing applications for small animal or human imaging.

"21812","Licensable Technology","Novel Compounds for Treating Alzheimer's Disease","Zhang, Xueli ; Ran, Chongzhao ; Moore, Anna V","The Technology:
The inventors have developed a compound that inhibits copper-induced amyloid beta (A-beta) crosslinking associated with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Covalent copper-induced crosslinking of A-beta contributes to the formulation of neurotoxic A-beta species found in AD. Existing amyloid plaque inhibitors focus on inhibiting reversible aggregation due to physical hydrophobic stacking, not on inhibiting this irreversible covalent crosslinking-related aggregation. The novel compounds compete with the copper binding sites within A-beta, attenuating covalent copper-induced A-beta crosslinking and inhibiting the formation of neurotoxic A-beta species. The effectiveness of the compound was validated in vivo with 6-month treatment, and the validation is supported by in vivo imaging data, ex vivo plaque counting and ELISA data.

Application:
The novel compounds can be used to treat Alzheimer's Disease by preventing the formation of neurotoxic A-beta species. As molecular pathological abnormalities such as A-beta crosslinking have been shown to start several years before the onset of AD clinical symptoms, these compounds could be used to treat AD at an early presymptomatic stage.

Advantages:
- Effective inhibition of covalent copper-induced A-beta crosslinking associated with Alzheimer's Disease with minimal disruption of brain metal homeostasis.
- Useful for treatment of Alzheimer's Disease at early and/or presymptomatic stages.

This type of defect often requires the replacement of the aortic valve. Artificial heart valves contain valve leaflets made of either natural material or polymers. These leaflets are designed and produced in a particular manner to ensure coaptation (i.e. complete closure) and prevent regurgitation of blood. This invention describes a novel design feature for heart valve leaflets which has the potential to solve a number of problems currently associated with replacement heart valves.

"3279","Licensable Technology","Novel methods for generating regulatory T-cells","Sharpe, Arlene H.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:The goal of Treg cell-based therapies is to reduce inappropriate or undesired immune responses, such as the immune response to self (autoimmune disease) or the immune response to transplanted organs and tissues (transplant rejection).  Agonists that target the cell surface receptor PD-1, such as its natural ligand PD-L1 or related agonists, are a promising new strategy to increase and or/maintain Treg cell activity in vivo, and may be useful for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and prevention of transplant rejection. PD-L1 agonists  provide a novel means to sustain and enhance the suppressive function of Treg function in vivo while concomitantly suppressing the expansion and functions of activated T effector cells.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) are key mediators of peripheral tolerance that can actively suppress effector T-cells, inhibit inflammation and mediate self-tolerance. Unlike naturally occurring Tregs (nTregs) which develop in the thymus, adaptive/induced (iTregs) develop in the periphery from naïve CD4+ Foxp3- T cells.  In the presence of TGF-b, naïve T cells can be induced to express the transcription factor Foxp3 and become iTreg.  These TGF-b induced Tregs potently suppress effector T cells. The programmed death 1 receptor (PD-1) is upregulated on T cells upon their activation and highly expressed on Tregs. Its ligand, PD-L1, is expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells, T cells, and a variety of nonhematopoietic cells including vascular endothelium, and at sites of immune privilege including the placenta and the eye. Interactions between PD-1 and PD-L help to regulate the balance between stimulatory and inhibitory signals needed for effective immunity and the maintenance of self-tolerance.  In particular, this pathway is known to regulate peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cell tolerance, and is a key mediator of T cell dysfunction (“exhaustion”) during chronic viral infection.Novel methods for inducing Tregs: Researchers in the Sharpe laboratory demonstrated that the PD-1:PD-L pathway is necessary for promoting iTreg development and sustaining Treg function.  They further developed novel methods for inducing and maintaining Tregs by targeting PD-1 expressed on the surface of CD4+ T cells.  Their findings are based on several lines of evidence: •  The capacity of APCs to convert naïve CD4+ T cells to iTregs is severely reduced when APCs are deficient in PD-L1•  Treating naïve CD4+ T cells with PD-L1-coated beads (along with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28) stimulates iTreg development in vitro•  Culturing iTregs with PD-L1-coated beads increases Foxp3 expression and enhances the suppressive function of iTreg•  PD-L1 and TGF- b have synergistic roles in regulating FoxP3+ iTreg development•  There is a marked reduction in iTreg conversion following transfer of naïve CD4+ T cells into mice deficient in PD-L1 and PD-L2 when compared to control mice•  Transfer of naïve CD4+ T cells into mice deficient in PD-L1 and PD-L2 rapidly produces a fatal inflammatory phenotype"," Drug Discovery Tools","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3279","Michal Preminger, (617) 432-0920","Harvard University"

Cancer causes about 13% of all deaths. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in development, and dysregulation of miRNA expression has been observed in human malignancies. It is necessary to balance the levels of miRNA for normal growth and development. The inventors found that Lin28, a developmentally regulated RNA binding protein, selectively blocks the processing of pri-let-7 miRNAs in embryonic cells. Using in vitro and in vivo studies, they found that Lin28 is necessary and sufficient for blocking microprocessor-mediated cleavage of pri-let-7 miRNAs.

The market is quite large; there are approximately 350,000 in the US and 2.5 million worldwide that suffer from MS.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:In multiple sclerosis, the host's immune system (lead by T-cells) attacks and destroys myelin basic protein, the principle component necessary for nerve transmission.  Part and parcel of this immune response pathway are the so-called Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules.  MHC molecules interact with myelin basic protein and bring it to the cell surface for interaction with T-cells, which in turn proliferate and dispose lethal inflammatory cytokines to the cell. This trimeric interaction between T-cells, myelin basic protein, and MHC molecules forms the foundation of Multiple Schlerosis' autoimmune response.  Consequently, there is a need to develop agents that can target and inhibit this critical focal point of the disease. This invention is a peptide therapy for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.  The peptides mimic myelin basic protein and inhibit proliferation of T-cells. The amino acid sequences of the peptide are made with modifications to their structure so as to enhance binding to MHC and the T-cell receptor.  This enhanced binding between the peptides, MHC, and T cell receptor inhibits downstream effectors of the MS autoimmune response and induces immunological tolerance.The myelin basic protein peptides have a greater affinity for binding to the MHC class II HLA-DR2 protein groove than an immunodominant epitope from myelin basic protein and an epitope comprising MBP residues 85-99.

The chemical can be synthesized, and used to develop a novel rodent control agent.   Unlike a number of commercially available rodent control agents, which are toxic to humans and domesticated animals, this compound is nontoxic and would have minimal adverse effects on wildlife and the environment.  Because it is a known compound which can be syntheisized, no urine collection is necessary. In addition, the odor is not detectable by humans.  Specific applications include:•     Area-wide application of the chemical•     Embedding the chemical within a material•     Applying the chemical to plants (grain), animals or objects in the environment that come in contact with rodents•     Developing a delivery device which releases the chemical into the airINNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Odors from carnivores elicit stereotyped fear and avoidance responses in rodents. These chemical cues are detected and avoided by their prey.  Predator-derived olfactory cues are sculpted by strong evolutionary pressure and are critical for survival. These chemicals may also be exploited to develop novel rodent control agents, although few of these chemicals, or the receptors they activate, have been identified.The Liberles laboratory identified a single chemical compound produced by predators that activates a particular mouse olfactory receptor and triggers hard-wired aversion circuits in the rodent.  Together, their data indicate that this predator-derived chemical is detected and avoided by prey, and can be used to develop a rodent control agent.Major Advantages:•     Known compound which can be synthesized•     Collection of animal urine is not necessary•     Odor  is not detectable by humans•     Compound is not toxic to humans or domesticated animals•     Humane method for deterring rodentsData from the Liberles laboratory:• The Liberles lab identified and isolated a predator cue from bobcat urine and showed that this chemical activates a particular rodent olfactory receptor in heterologous cells.  In addition, calcium imaging of neuronal responses from mouse olfactory tissue demonstrated that a subset of sensory neurons detects the chemical.• Quantitative HPLC analysis across 38 mammalian species indicates enriched production of the chemical by numerous carnivores, with some producing >3,000 fold more than herbivores examined.

The inventors have developed novel sensors of micro RNA (miRNA) activity that enable sensitive, high-throughput, PCR-free profiling of miRNA in both cell-free systems and intact cells. Currently, miRNA profiling relies on PCR and northern blotting or high-affinity hybridization probes, which are expensive and inapplicable to intact live cells. The novel sensors are fluorescent turn-on oligonucleotides (""oligos""), which are incubated with intact live cells or lysates, resulting in flourescent turn-on of the oligos. Profiling of miRNA is then carried out with a simple fluorescence reading using as microscope, plate reader, or any other analogous instrument.

Application:
The miRNA epigenome represents a fundamental molecular regulator of cell fate. Consequently, developing tools to profile miRNA expression can lead to the mapping out of a comprehensive and systematic atlas of cell function. This technology could also be instrumental in detecting and monitoring changes of miRNAs in various pathological conditions, and can inform the development of miRNA-based therapies for diseases such as cancer or diabetes. 

Advantages:
- These sensors can be used in intact live cells, which is not possible with current methods, permitting longitudinal studies to be conducted that monitor the evolution of an intact cell's miRNA signature over time.
- Sensitivity: The sensors have nanomolar sensitivity to miRNA.
- Specificity: The expected specificity is >99.5%. Because oligos can be designed to discriminate between a single-base mismatch, the technology has a single-base specificity.
- Cost: The proposed assay is inexpensive ($40/L of assay solution) and requires only a fluorimeter, eliminating the need for expensive equipment used in current methods.

These inhibitors can be used individually at lethal doses and also in a combinatorial approach at sub-lethal doses.  Combinatorial synthetic lethality creates new opportunities for effective anti-bacterial therapy, while diminishing the possibility of spontaneous drug resistance.Identification of Novel Cell Division InhibitorsCollaborative research between Harvard and Tufts Universities has validated the cell division target FtsZ using an in vitro and a chemical genetic whole-cell screen and identified novel small molecule inhibitors against this essential target that belong to three distinct chemical scaffolds. The Escherichia coli cell-based screen has yielded two broad classes of inhibitors: (a) molecules that cause lethal cell filamentation and inhibit FtsZ GTPase in vitro (FtsZ-specific inhibitors) and (b) molecules that induce cell filamentation and death without affecting the biochemical properties of FtsZ in any significant way.  The phenotypes caused by class (b) molecules suggest that they may target essential division proteins other than FtsZ (non-FtsZ inhibitors).•The FtsZ-specific inhibitors identified and their three chemical scaffolds could serve as leads for an antibacterial drug development program.•Analogues of the FtsZ-specific inhibitors should allow for composition of matter claims. These FtsZ-specific inhibitors would be used individually at lethal doses.•Some of the FtsZ-specific inhibitors currently identified and protected by use claims may be appropriate for a drug development program.•The in vitro and a chemical genetic whole-cell assays could be licensed separately on a non-exclusive basis.Combinatorial Approach at Sub-Lethal ConcentrationsThe portfolio of inhibitors identified in the above screens that target FtsZ and other septation proteins in the cell division pathway were tested for their ability to cause synergistic bacterial killing at sub-lethal doses.  The multiprotein septal ring is critical for bacterial division and is a dynamic structure; therefore, it was hypothesized that simultaneous partial inhibition of two or more essential proteins residing in the septal ring could lead to synergistic inhibition of cell division and cell growth. Results demonstrated that FtsZ-specific inhibitors used in binary combinations with non-FtsZ inhibitors killed E. coli cells at sub-lethal concentrations that were significantly lower than the individual MIC of each inhibitor.AdvantagesThe combinatorial synthetic lethality approach provides the following advantages:•Allows lower doses of compounds to be used; therefore, it would significantly reduce the chances of spontaneous resistance arising in bacteria against the binary or tertiary combinations of inhibitors.•Is adaptable for high throughout screening, allowing for an efficient exploration of the small-molecule combinatorial space and a full exploitation of the potential of small chemical libraries.•Creates an exciting approach for novel anti-bacterial therapy through combinations with clinically proven antibiotics. One of the conserved bacterial cell division genes is ftsI that codes for the penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 3 in E. coli. The FtsZ–specific and –nonspecific septation inhibitors identified could be combined effectively with beta-lactam antibiotics that have high affinity for septation-specific PBP 3.•Renders low potency molecules effective anti-bacterial agents when used in binary combinations.•Requires only sub-lethal concentrations to be used for each inhibitor  to achieve partial inhibition; therefore it augments target selectivity by minimizing the effects of inhibitors on low-affinity secondary targets in the bacterial cell.•Reduces the therapeutic dosage level required of each compound and hence the potential for drug cytotoxicity in the host. Ongoing and Future Studies•Structural analogues of certain FtsZ-specific inhibitors are being synthesized and tested for improved activity in SAR studies.•Studies on FtsZ antagonism and specific mechanism of action.•Identification of cellular targets of class (b) molecules (non-FtsZ inhibitors).•Studies currently in the planning stage would strive to solve the co-crystal structure of FtsZ complexed with small molecule FtsZ-specific inhibitors.

"3549","Licensable Technology","Novel target for Angelman Syndrome and Autism Spectrum Disorders","Greenberg, Michael E","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Angelman syndrome (AS) and Autistic spectrum disorders (ASD): Although it has been known for more than a decade that mutation of Ube3A results in AS, remarkably little is understood about the role of Ube3A in the cognitive impairment underlying AS. This lack of insight has hampered the development of therapeutic strategies for treating AS, and as a result there are currently no effective treatments for this disorder.  This research pinpoints potential therapeutic targets for the development of therapies to treat diseases associated with mutations in Ube3A including AS and ASD.  Arc: The Greenberg lab demonstrated that disruption of Ube3A activity leads to an increase of Arc and decrease in AMPAR expression at synapses.  Drugs that promote AMPAR expression at synapses, such as metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5) antagonists or compounds that inhibit the expression or function or Arc, may reverse symptoms associated with AS and ASD.  Fragile X is a human disorder in which a similar decrease in AMPAR expression at synapses has been demonstrated. This decrease has further been shown to be a result of excessive mGluR5 signaling, resulting in increased Arc translation and excessive AMPAR internalization.  Selective mGluR5 antagonists are now entering clinical trials for the treatment of Fragile X, indicating that this type of therapeutic strategy has potentialEphexin5: Disruption of Ube3A also results in an increase of Ephexin5, leading to aberrant EphB/Ephexin5 signaling, and a disruption of EphB-dependent excitatory synapse development.  Compounds that inhibit Ephexin5 activity and stimulate excitatory synapse formation, may reverse symptoms associated with AS and ASD.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Background: Angleman Syndrome (AS) is a neuro-genetic disorder characterized by intellectual and developmental delay as well as sleep disturbance, seizure and trembling movements.  This debilitating neurological disorder is caused by mutation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase (Ube3A), a gene whose mutation has also recently been associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD).  However, the function of Ube3A in mediating cognitive impairment in individuals with AS and ASDs, as well as its substrates, have been unknown.  Invention:  The Greenberg laboratory first demonstrated that neural activity induces Ube3A transcription, and that a decrease in Ube3A expression decreases the plasma membrane expression of, and synaptic transmission through AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPARs).  To better understand the role of Ube3A in AS and ASD, the Greenberg lab identified key neural substrates of Ube3A, Arc and Ephexin5, and the mechanisms for their regulation of synaptic transmission.  Their findings suggest mechanisms by which Ube3A contributes to cognitive dysfunction in AS and ASD. •     Arc is a substrate of Ube3A.  The Greenberg lab searched mammalian genomes for proteins that contain a Ube3A binding domain.  Their search identified Arc, a protein known to rapidly increase upon glutamate release at excitatory synapses, which regulates the trafficking and expression of AMPARs at synapses.  Arc-mediated endocytosis of AMPARs is known to dampen neuronal excitability, and in turn, limit the level of neuronal excitation.  The role of Ube3A may therefore be to bind to and regulate Arc-mediated endocytosis to maintain proper synaptic activation.  •     Ube3A controls synaptic function by ubiquitinating and degrading Arc.  They next showed that Ube3A controls the level of Arc protein expression by ubiquitinating and thus targeting Arc for degradation.  In this way, Ube3A reduces the Arc-mediated internalization of AMPARs.•     Ephexin5 negatively regulates excitatory synapse development.  Recent research reveals an important role for Eph receptor tyrosine kinases in the early cell-cell contact phase that is critical for excitatory synapse formation.  EphBs are highly expressed in neurons, and are positive regulators of excitatory synapse development by triggering the recruitment of AMPA and NMDA subtypes of excitatory glutamate receptors.  The inventors identified a RhoA guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Ephexin5, which interacts with EphB2 as determined by co-immunoprecipitation, and co-localization using immunofluorescence microscopy. In addition, they showed that Ephexin5 negatively regulates excitatory synapse development by knocking down the levels of Ephexin5 protein expression in cultured neurons, which resulted in a significant increase in the number of excitatory synapses.  The lab also demonstrated that Ephexin5 functions directly to restrict the synapse-promoting effects of EphB2, suggesting that in order for EphB2 to positively regulate synapse development, it is necessary to inactivate and/or degrade Ephexin5.•     Ephexin5 is a substrate of Ube3A.  The inventors showed that Ephexin5 co-immunoprecipitates with Ube3A but not with other E3 ligases.  In addition, they identified a Ube3A binding domain in Ephexin5.•     Ube3A ubiquitinates and degrades Ephexin5.  The lab demonstrated that EphB triggers the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues on Ephexin5.  Ubiquitination and degradation of Ephexin5 is then mediated by Ube3A, which promotes EphB-dependent excitatory synapse development.  Their results suggest that phosphorylation of Ephexin5 by EphB is required for the Ube3A-mediatied degradation.  •     Ube3A’s role in cognitive dysfunction.  The lab used a mouse model of Angelman syndrome, which is deficient in Ube3A, to further elucidate the role of Ube3A in cognitive dysfunction. This mouse was shown to have elevated levels of Arc in neurons, resulting in excessive internalization of AMPARs at synapses and impaired synaptic transmission.  The disregulation of AMPAR expression may contribute to the cognitive dysfunction in AS and possibly other ASDs.     This mouse model also has decreased levels of ubiquitinated Ephexin5 and increased levels of Ephexin5 protein expression.  These findings suggest that aberrant EphB/Ephexin5 signaling, leading to a disruption in EphB-dependent excitatory synapse development and function, contributes to the abnormal cognitive function that occurs in AS and possibly other ASDs."," Drug Discovery Tools","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3549","Michal Preminger, (617) 432-0920","Harvard University"
"JDP-094","Licensable Technology","Novel Target for Treatment of Diabetes","Ronald Kahn, M.D. et al.","The invention is based on the discovery of a new target, not previously known to be linked to diabetes. Microarray analysis of human pancreatic islets from people with Type 2 diabetes, compared to controls with normal glucose tolerance, led to identification of a transcription factor that was down-regulated in the diabetic individuals. This factor was expressed in all of the control individuals but expression was not detected in microarray analysis of samples from any of the diabetic subjects: using RT-PCR, expression of the factor in diabetic subjects was 10% of that in control subjects. Beta-cell specific knockout mice lacking the gene encoding this transcription factor developed beta cell dysfunction and diabetes. In vitro experiments confirm the changes in glucose-responsive insulin secretion and mRNA levels seen in vivo to result from decreased levels of this transcription factor. The invention provides a novel target for drug development and therapeutic intervention against both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Agents that might enhance expression or activity of the transcription factor, including several that are known, could be used to treat diabetes. The invention includes methods of treating diabetes by increasing the activity or level of the factor; methods of drug screening against this target, and methods of detecting the risk, predisposition, or presence of diabetes in a subject by measuring levels of the transcription factor."," Drug Discovery Tools  |   Genomics/Proteomics  |   Drug Discovery Tools","http://www.joslinresearch.org/inventions","David J.

Patients with this rearrangement have reduced histone acetylation which leads to cell proliferation. As such, these patients are likely to benefit from therapy with agents that promote increased histone acetylation (e.g. histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors).

Application: This technology can be used to (i) identify patients that harbor BRD-NUT and NUT-variant chromosomal rearrangements (e.g. patients with NRC) and (ii) treat such patients with HDAC inhibitors.

Advantages: This technology provides a potential diagnostic test and tailored therapy for the treatment of NUT--Rearranged carcinomas which are aggressive. 
For instance, NUT-Rearranged Carcinoma patients are currently treated with Ewings Sarcoma Therapy which generally results in partial remission followed by recurrence and death. These patients might benefit from targeted treatment with HDAC inhibitors.

HDAC inhibitors have traditionally been used to treat neurological disorders. As such, companies with HDAC inhibitors either in development or in the market could expand the indication for their compounds for the treatment of certain types of solid tumors.

This unique clinical procedure is known as planned myocardial infarction (PMI) and samples fluid drawn from near the hearts of patients both before and after an induced MI. From this protein-rich fluid they identified a list of candidate biomarkers – proteins whose levels had changed during the attack. They then narrowed the list to those found in blood taken far from the heart, which hospital clinicians would typically draw from cardiac patients. Finally, they used targeted assays to select new candidate biomarkers and then measure peripheral blood levels in distinct PMI patients.

A solution comprising liquid crystalline DNA nanotubes is resistant to detergent and enables liquid-crystal NMR spectroscopy of membrane proteins solubilized in detergent.  The DNA nanotube liquid crystals can be manufactures on a large-scale to achieve economies of scale, and then sold in aliquots to solution NMR spectroscopists across the world interested in solving the structure of clinically-relevant membrane proteins that can be the focus of structure based drug design.

Current problems with the state of NMR for membrane proteins:
? Membrane-embedded proteins are not readily amenable to existing crystallization methods. Solution NMR can be used to obtain structural information without the need for crystallization ? but this requires that proteins are solubilized in detergents. This limits the practicality of this approach to relatively small membrane associated proteins. 
? It is believed that ~30% of all expressed polypeptides are membrane associated, and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels, which are integral membrane proteins, comprise more thant 50% of human drug targets (see market indicators page). 

How this invention will solve this problem: 
? Makes possible the accurate measurement of residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) for a wide array of detergent solubilized proteins. This will facilitate the de novo NMR structure determination of large membrane proteins that cannot be determined using current techniques. 
? This could potentially extend the size limit for solution-NMR based structure determination of membrane proteins ? making it possible to determine the structures of larger membrane proteins that are good drug targets. 

How it would be sold as a product:
? Sold as a consumable solution that everyone running an NMR spec would use to determine membrane structure 

Use of solution NMR in Drug Discovery
? Used in support of structure-based drug design,  in which the 3-D structure of a drug target interacting with small molecules is used to guide drug discovery 
? NMR is also used upstream in the drug discovery process to determine how a new drug will bind with its target molecule, optimizing leads, and as a component of the screening process 

The increasing use of NMR:
? NMR spectroscopy sales are estimated at $350-400 million annually 
? Demand for drug discovery applications is estimated to grow at an average of 10% per year"," Drug Discovery Tools","n/a","Eric J. Stevenson, Ph.D. Phone: (617) 632-5621 Fax: (617) 632-4012 eric_stevenson@dfci.harvard.edu","Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"

However, not all obese patients have the same risk of developing these disorders. Individuals with peripheral obesity, i.e., fat distributed subcutaneously in the gluteofemoral region, are at little or no risk of the common medical complications of obesity, whereas individuals with central obesity, i.e., fat accumulated in visceral depots, are prone to these complications. The research leading to this invention explored the hypothesis that patterns of fat distribution and perhaps, to some degree, obesity itself may have a developmental genetic origin. The inventors found major differences in expression of multiple genes involved in embryonic development and pattern specification between adipocytes taken from intra-abdominal and subcutaneous depots in rodents and humans. Some of these developmental genes exhibit changes in expression that are closely correlated with level of obesity and the pattern of fat distribution. The gene expression profiling carried out by the inventors has led to the identification of numerous genes and proteins whose expression is differentially regulated between adipocytes from intra-abdominal (visceral) fat and subcutaneous (peripheral) fat. These proteins are potential targets for further research into the mechanisms of obesity and may also be promising targets for therapeutic intervention.

Ultrasound and magnetic fields can be temporally and spatially controlled, and can be safely applied repeatedly if needed, thus provides a non-invasive means of boosting intracellular drug delivery that can be more advantageous for clinical applications.The technology is a localized drug-releasing polymer for on-demand treatment of pain, inflammation, or other localized, chronic conditions.  Cancer and osteoarthritis may be of initial clinical importance.  Proof of principle has been demonstrated in mitoxantrone, an anti-cancer chemotherapy treatment.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Researchers have discovered a self-healable polymer matrix, capable of maintaining its integrity and stiffness in physiological environments, release therapeutics at a controlled rate via polymer degradation mediated by an ultrasound, and restore previous polymer structure upon removal of the ultrasound stimulus.  This polymer shows promise for use in site directed, on-demand, reversible drug release.When stimulated by ultrasound, the polymer undergoes sonic shock, introducing cavitations into the matrix, which releases the encapsulated therapeutics.  As the drugs are released through the cavities, the reversibly physical cross-links in the cavities begin to reform.  This class of polymers is, therefore, self-healable in a physiological environment.  The lab further developed a macroporous gel that is sensitive to magnetic fields.  The porosity of these ferrogels, as well as the strength of the applied magnetic field, can be tuned to control the release rate of drugs from the gel.  Like the polymer matrix, the ferrogel can be used for on-demand, reversible drug release.By applying ultrasound or a magnetic field to a self-healable polymer matrix or ferrogel, encapsulated compounds of both high (plasmid DNA) and low-molecular weights (small molecules) are delivered at controlled rates.

Zebrafish are amenable to genetic screens, develop rapidly ex-utero, are transparent, and are highly fecund; they are therefore an attractive alternative to current animal disease models.  Accordingly, this technology provides fish cancer models--transgenic fish that bear oncogenes operably linked to desired promoters.  This technology features a zebrafish model in which T cell leukemia is induced using mouse c-myc under control of the lymphoid-cell-specific zebrafish Rag2 promoter.  

Applications/Advantages: Prior to this technology, stable lines of tumor-bearing transgenic fish have not been available.  These fish tumor models offer tremendous advantages in cancer research.  On a per-animal basis, zebrafish require considerably less resources to maintain than rodent or primate animal models.  This opens the possibility of in vivo high-throughput screening of new cancer therapeutics, including 96-well adaptations.  Further, since zebrafish are transparent, one may observe the same specimen non-invasively throughout the course of therapy to gauge efficacy.

Some examples of such applications include, but are not limited to, in vitro fertilization, moving and positioning individual biological cells for research or tissue assembly, microinjecting or transfecting individual cells, controlled manipulation of objects with nanometer-scale dimensions, and building useful devices from nanoscale components by precisely placing the components in desired locations.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:This invention is capable of positioning and sensing particles with intense localized electric fields. In one implementation of the invention, closely spaced electrodes on a tip generate a local radio frequency (RF) electric field at the end of the tip. In one aspect, the tip can be positioned by a manipulator or by a scanning probe microscope (SPM). In another aspect, the dielectrophoretic force produced by the FR field is used to trap microscopic objects and particles. Once trapped, the microscopic objects or particles can be positioned or otherwise manipulated by moving the tip via the SPM or other manipulator. Monitoring the conductance between the electrodes provides a means for sensing the presence of a particle trapped at the end of the tip.To achieve effective DEP trapping forces, conventional microfabrication methods may be used to deposit two electrodes in a variety of manners onto a sharp elongated object (an SPM tip, an AFM tip, a sharpened glass tip). Matching the electrode spacing to the size of the particle, particles with diameters from hundreds of microns to tens of nanometers can be trapped. The trapping force further may be tuned by adjusting the amplitude and frequency of the voltage applied to the two electrodes. The localized nature of the RF field and DEP force facilitates single-particle manipulation. In operation, the tip is scanned close to the target particle. By applying a voltage across the electrodes, the ""tweezers"" tip can ""pick up"" the particle.

With these tweezers, researchers can isolate, measure, and sort small structures, including very small biological structures, such as DNA. They can also study and measure small forces within a cell to better understand how microscopic biological motors move and how they affect the biological structures around them. Most optical tweezers require an extensive set of expensive laboratory hardware to support their use. Therefore, they are usually custom built for each use. Dr. Kenneth Crozier has implemented two technologies that have dramatically improved optical tweezers. With these improvements, Dr. Crozier could entirely change what they are used for, how they are used, who can buy them, and probably how they are built. Because the optical tweezers are smaller and use less energy, they can be used with more devices, such as lab-on-a-chip systems, atomic force microscopy, nano-assembly, and patch-clamp analysis. Because the optical tweezers work with small objects, they can extend research to more complex and highly parallel studies and measurements of biological systems. Because they cost much less, they could be commercially built and sold.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Based on pioneering work in high-intensity, near-field laser structures, the Crozier lab developed two optical tweezers technologies that significantly reduced the size of the tweezers themselves, and the size of the objects that they can focus on. The nanoscale optical antennae technology reduced the size of the spot the tweezers can focus on; the Fresnel zone plate technology improved the focus ability.

Electrical alternans is a pattern of variation in the shape of the electrocardiographic waveform that appears on an every other beat basis.  In humans, alternation in ventricular repolarization, namely repolarization alternans (RA), has been associated with increased vulnerability to ventricular tachy-arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.

Inventors from the cardiology division at MGH have developed an analysis algorithm that can sensitively detect repolarization alternans through placing leads in an intracardiac configuration.  The algorithm can predict the onset of a tachyarrhythmic event and can be bundled into implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices  for treating arrhythmia.


Applications:

-	This device could predict the onset of a tachyarrythmia and issue a signal to terminate the arrhythmia, thus preventing the arrhythmia from occurring.

Advantages:

-	Detecting and preventing arrhythmia before it happens would greatly improve patient care.
-	Patient would be unaware of correction, relieving the unpleasant experience of arrhythmia correction from a defibrillator.
-	Algorithm can be easily incorporated in to existing ICDs

Investigators at Massachusetts General Hospital have discovered a small molecule, Optovin, a thioxothiazolidinone, that can activate a specific group of neurons upon violet light stimulation. This action is mediated by interaction with TRPA1 channels, channels which are expressed in several classes of neurons, including sensory neurons and known to mediate pain perception.  Violet light- induced Optovin activation of TRPA1 channels can be precisely controlled in terms of location, duration and intensity. Furthermore, light stimulation-driven Optovin action when applied externally, results in muscle movement in zebrafish models.

The permeability and half-life are often limiting factors in the development of new drugs, particularly large molecules. ||

The investigators have recently discovered that the fatty acid structure of a particular ceramide dictates trafficking of the lipid into either the recycling endosome (short or unsaturated FA’s) or lysosome pathways (long chain FA’s) of cultured human epithelial cells. This technology exploits a pathway that a pathogen normally uses to direct intracellular trafficking of its toxin, harnessing it to enable safe macromolecular transport of drugs across mucosal epithelial barriers while increasing that drug’s serum half-life. This invention could avoid the need for parenteral administration of large protein drugs and potentially overcome unintended side effects.

Currently, surgical implants are coated with components of the ECM to enhance bone healing around metallic implants.  These methods are problematic due to difficulties in obtaining stable attachment to the material and instability towards enzymatic degradation in the organism.  An alternative approach is to coat implants using small peptides containing only the binding sequences of known natural protein ligands.  However, this approach has been limited because neither the ECM protein that induces osteoblast differentiation, nor the receptor proteins of osteoblast progenitor cells, is clearly defined.  Dr. Nagai’s mesh chambers provide a method to screen peptide and small molecule libraries in order to study the ECM and its role in tissue formation, cell mobility and differentiation.  Further, the discovery of proteins that induce osteoblast differentiation is important for the development of new biomaterials that actively and selectively stimulate cellular functions important for tissue growth and healing.  Use of osteoinductive peptides to enhance bone regeneration will offer several advantages, including:•  Increased stability•  Simple syntheses of short sequences•  Ability to incorporate them at much higher concentrations than full proteinsINNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Dr. Nagai developed a novel high throughput screening method for the unbiased selection of peptides that bind to components of the extracellular matrix (ECM).  The method uses a cell growing chamber with a mesh support that allows for cell attachment as well as delivery of reagents through the mesh.  The chamber is exposed to a phage library in which each phage expresses a random peptide sequence on its surface.  Phages with affinity for receptors on the target cells, such as ECM receptors on osteogenic cells, are then amplified and analyzed.  Researchers in Dr. Nagai’s laboratory then used secondary and tertiary screens on ECM-binding phages to identify peptide sequences that 1) attach to osteoblast precursors and 2) support the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblast progenitor cells.  The laboratory screened 180 million random dodecamer peptides, and selected and sequenced 21 osteoinductive peptides shown to be specific to osteoblasts.Further investigations in Dr. Nagai’s laboratory will study the acceleration of bone regeneration by novel peptides compared to commercially available peptides known to help with bone defects.  This will be addressed by conducting 1) in vitro experiments to assay the functional activity and stability of each peptide, and 2) in vivo experiments to assess bone regeneration capacity of each peptide.  In addition, the laboratory plans to determine the optimal delivery system for the peptides, as well as the optimal combination of multiple peptides.Methods for the biopanning assay, as well as the osteoinductive peptides are available for worldwide, exclusive licensing."," Biomaterials","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3473","Grant Zimmermann, (617) 495-3067","Harvard University"

"4039","Licensable Technology","Oxygen-activated gold as a green catalyst for selective methoxycarbonylation","Friend, Cynthia","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Dialkyl carbonates are widely used as solvents, reactive reagents, lubricants and fuel additives in industry. In particular, dimethyl carbonate is used as a green reagent for methylation and methoxycarbonylation. Large-scale industrial production of dimethyl carbonate was 170 tons/day in 1997 and worldwide demand far exceeds current production capacity. However, current processes to produce dimethyl carbonate either involve toxic reagents, undesirable chemical wastes or extreme reaction conditions. A green and selective process can help meet this huge demand.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:A group of Harvard scientists led by Profs. Madix and Friend has developed a catalyst based on gold for very selective production of dimethyl carbonate. The new process is environmentally friendly and its advantages are threefold. First, it starts with inexpensive chemicals such methanol, oxygen and carbon monoxide and operates at low temperatures. Second, the catalyst is highly selective. Model studies show that nearly 100 percent of the starting materials got converted to dimethyl carbonate. Third, the gold catalyst can be easily recycled without using toxic organic solvents. Because only the gold surface acts as the catalyst, gold can be used in the form of thin films or nanoparticles to minimize material use while maintaining its catalytic capability. This innovation is not limited to the production of dimethyl carbonate and is applicable to other dialkyl carbonate production as well."," Chemical Engineering  |   Chemistry","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=4039","Mick Sawka, (617) 496-3830","Harvard University"

However, one major drawback of the currently available cell-based assay systems is the high false-positive rate resulting from non-specific effects within the cells.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Harvard researchers developed a reliable, high-throughput screening assay to identify activators and inhibitors of p53. This cell-based luminescence assay measures the level of a reporter gene product under the control of a promoter containing a p53-binding site.P53 is a transcription factor that can activate multiple genes involved in cell cycle regulation, DNA repair and programmed cell-death. It is often described as the ""gatekeeper"" of cellular integrity and plays a central role in tumor suppression. It is the most frequently mutated protein in human cancers. This assay features a triple read-out system where:     -Two cell lines express different reporter genes under the control of the same p53- binding promoter.    - A third cell line expresses a third reporter gene under the control of a constitutive promoter.Figure 1: Three reporter cell-lines in one assay well: the screen identifies compounds that specifically affect p-53-dependant firefly luciferase (FL) and secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) expression without affecting CMV promoter-driven renilla luciferase (RL) expression. The influence of flanking DNA-sequences is controlled by the first two cell-lines. General effects such as cytotoxicity are measured in the third cell-line. These build-in controls thus minimize non-specific effects to identify true hits in one screen.In screening experiments, this assay has been performed on a 384-well plate format to screen on a diverse collection of 16,320 synthetic compounds and effectively selected several chemicals that specifically affect transcriptional activity of p53. We believe this assay can be successfully adapted to higher density plate formats such as 1536- and 6144- well plates.Figure 2: Screen for chemicals which affect p53-dependant FL and SEAP expression without affecting CMV promoter-driven RL expression.  This inventive cell-based assay:     -     Allows to screen compounds under physiological conditions;     -     Identifies chemicals that specifically affect p53 expression;     -     Controls non-specific effects;     -     Eliminates the need for multiple screenings;     -     Allows high-throughput screens."," Research Tools","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=1699","Michal Preminger, (617) 432-0920","Harvard University"

These materials comprise panels in which many short fibers are attached at one end to a substrate, so that the closely-packed fibers extend away from the substrate in an essentially perpendicular manner. The panels may be used alone or multiple panels may be stacked.
A FEAM material according to the invention can be used by itself or to enhance existing sports/military helmet energy absorption systems (e.g. making use of foam layers). The material blunts impact like an airbag. FEAM operates as a flexible ‘spacer’ fabric; worn between the helmet or armor and the body surface providing a broad, spring-like compressible air space. FEAM performance can be customized based on fiber denier and length used in construction. FEAM materials can serve as a breathable liner, a layer inside existing cranial and body protection garments such as football, hockey, baseball, bicycle and skateboarding helmets and body armor. This new fibrous material could also provide other body padding like shin, elbow and knee pads. FEAM elements can be effectively enveloped in fabric to provide a complete stand-alone energy-absorbing pad configuration or adhered to existing padding. These materials are lightweight, low cost, and customizable, with the ability to blunt impacts effectively and to spring back instantaneously, while offering breathable comfort.

"3231","Licensable Technology","Paper-supported 3D cell culture for cell and tissue-based bioassays","Whitesides, George M.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Fundamental investigations of human biology, and the development of therapeutics, commonly rely on 2D cell-culture systems that do not accurately recapitulate the structure, function, or physiology of living tissues. Systems for 3D cultures exist but do not replicate the spatial distributions of oxygen, metabolites, and signaling molecules found in tissues. Microfabrication can create architecturally complex scaffolds for 3D cell cultures that circumvent some of these limitations; unfortunately, these approaches require instrumentation not commonly available in biology laboratories.Researchers in the laboratory of George Whitesides have developed a simple and versatile strategy for controlling the distribution of cultured cells in 3D by fabrication of mono- or multilaminate structures of fiber-supported hydrogels, where each layer is composed of chromatography paper impregnated with an extracellular matrix hydrogel containing living cells. This discovery has implications for both high-throughput drug screening and tissue engineering.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:In this new approach, cells are cultured in 3D on a paper scaffold by adding a hydrogel precursor, as a fluid containing suspended cells, to a paper support, allowing the cell-containing fluid to distribute through the paper by capillary wicking, gelling it in place, and then submerging the support in growth media. This simple procedure generates durable 3D fiber-supported gels with defined numbers and densities of cells with easily controlled lateral dimensions and with thickness defined by the paper. Individual layers can be easily manipulated and, if desired, stacked to form thicker multilayer constructs with dimensions that mimic the environment of cells in tissues, where the diffusion limited distribution of oxygen, nutrients, metabolites, and signaling molecules come into play.  The stacked constructs may be designed to exhibit desired spatial distributions of cells, and can be easily destacked to analyze cell structure and function within physical sections of these 3D tissue-like structures without requiring optical or histological sectioning. This paper-based cell-culture platform is readily integrated with cell-based assays and high-throughput screens for drug discovery. For example, multiple layers of paper can be incorporated into standard microwell plates by assembling multiple layers of paper, 96-zone plates, and commercially available bottomless 96-well plates. The platform could also be combined with existing technologies for the synthesis of chemical libraries on paper to provide for entirely new screening strategies. Finally, the platform is well-suited to co-culture screening strategies and tissue engineering experiments."," Biomaterials  |   Drug Discovery Tools  |   Biomaterials  |   Drug Discovery Tools  |   Biomaterials","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3231","Mick Sawka, (617) 496-3830","Harvard University"

The ability to pattern thin polymer films on substrates is central to microelectronics, optics, MEMS and biochemistry.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Patterning surfaces to create some function is a core technology propelling our technical society. The most important such technology, photolithography, is used to create IC chips with nanoscale features. It is also the most expensive with fab capital costs greater than several billion dollars.  Not all surface patterning needs require nanoscale resolution.  Soft lithography, pioneered by George Whitesides, can create patterns on a surface in the microscale using a suite of techniques easily carried out in an ordinary lab or factory environment with capital costs in the thousands of dollars.  Soft lithography is beginning to be used to make commercial products.  The current soft lithography invention is useful for creating patterns of metals and semiconductors on a surface with a resolution on the border of the nano- and microscale. The invention takes advantage of a property of a polymer like polyacrylic acid (PAA), which is water soluble when its counterion is monocationic (i.e, Na+1) and not crosslinking and insoluble in water when its counterion is a doubly charged and is crosslinking (i.e., Zn+2).  A template of surface microfluidic channels, in a desired pattern,  is impressed on a soluble PAA layer and Zn+2   solution in the channels converts soluble PAA into insoluble PAA impregnated with zinc ions in the pattern of the microfluidic template.  Removing the template and washing with water leaves the zinc ion impregnated PAA in the pattern of the template.  Now one can use this patterned surface as a template for chemical conversion to zinc nanoparticles (by reduction) or to form compounds of zinc such as zinc sulfide, a semiconductor.  The PAA can be removed by oxygen plasma.  Other metals such as Al, Ti, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Pd, La, Gd, Ho, Pb and U can be used.  Nanoparticles can be used as nucleation sites for the growth of patterned microstructures.  Different channels can carry different metal solutions allowing complex structures with more than one metal to be produced.  The microfluidic template is made using well-known and inexpensive soft lithography techniques, such as described in the publication entitled, ''Microfluidic Devices Fabricated in Poly(Dimethylsiloxane)for Biological Studies Electrophoresis'', 2003, 24, 3563-3576."," Fluidics/Microfluidics  |   Plastics and Polymers Engineering  |   Electrical Engineering  |   Plastics and Polymers Engineering  |   Electrical Engineering  |   Plastics and Polymers Engineering  |   Electrical Engineering","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=2799","Sam Liss, (617) 495-4371","Harvard University"

"CCMC   2296","Licensable Technology","Peptide-based inhibitor for treating chronic viral and autoimmune inflammatory diseases","Kagan, Jonathan","Dr. Kagan's lab has developed a novel peptide-based inhibitor of Rig-I-like receptor (RLR)-mediated signal transduction that could serve as a good molecular candidate for therapeutic modulation of the immune response. RLRs have emerged as critical sentinels of viral infection, surveying the cytosol of all mammalian cell types for the presence of viruses containing RNA genomes.  In addition to sensing viral RNAs, RLRs are important regulators of a growing list of non-infectious immunopathologies that may result from an inappropriate host response to self RNA. RLR-mediated detection of viral RNA results in the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS)-dependent activation of antiviral signaling pathways that result in the expression of cytokines, interferons (IFNs) and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs).  While these responses are critical for clearing viral infections, they are also deleterious in the context of autoimmunity.  The reason for this is that many of the factors induced by RLRs are responsible for activating autoreactive T-cells.  Thus, depending on the clinical symptoms, some patients may benefit from inhibition of the RLR/MAVS signaling pathways (e.g. T1D patients) whereas others may benefit from activating these pathways (HCV patients).  ||

Building off of Dr. Kagan's knowledge of the various antiviral pathways that function in mammals, they created a peptide inhibitor of RLR-mediated signal transduction. This inhibitor provides the first molecular tool available to disrupt the functions of this family in human cells, and may also be applicable for manipulating RLR pathways in mouse models of infection/autoimmunity.  Moreover, the strategy used to design these RLR inhibitors may be adapted to generate peptides that activate the RLR pathways.  Peptide activators of RLR signaling may prove particularly useful in treating chronic viral infections such as Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), as these viruses function to block antiviral signaling pathways."," Therapeutics - Drugs","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=2296","Meyer, Abbie, abbie.meyer@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"
"JDP-009","Licensable Technology","Peptides Having Insulin Autoantibody But Not Insulin Receptor Binding Capacity","George Eisenbarth, M.D., Ph.D.  et al.","Many diabetic patients being treated with insulin develop autoantibodies to insulin as a natural outcome of the therapy. These autoantibodies are generally believed to recognize a portion of the insulin molecule that corresponds to the receptor-binding site; antibody binding to insulin at this site interferes with the ability of insulin to bind its receptor, and thereby interferes with insulin activity. The invention makes use of peptide analogues of insulin that retain the ability to bind to insulin autoantibodies but not bind to the insulin receptor. Such peptides can bind and block the autoantibodies without blocking the ability of the administered insulin to bind and activate the receptor. These peptides can be coupled to cytotoxic peptides to target and kill the B-cells that produce the insulin autoantibodies. 
    The peptides of the invention can be administered to patients as an adjunct to insulin therapy, to induce patient tolerance to insulin by blocking autoantibody activity. In another embodiment, the peptides are conjugated to a cytotoxic peptide, which can provide a faster or more efficient route to insulin tolerance by targeting autoreactive B lymphocytes, thereby decreasing the production of insulin autoantibodies.

- Discomfort and frustration for the patient and clinician from multiple punctures several times per day; 
- Increased risk of infection from multiple punctures;
- Increased risk of the clinician suffering a needle stick; 

This device is a creative solution that safely allows blood to be drawn from an existing IV line without increasing the patient s risk of infection or of the IV clotting. 

The inventor, a clinical nurse, has developed a prototype and has demonstrated proof of concept in a porcine model.

Applications:

- Provides the ability to safely and repeatedly draw blood from a patient s IV

Advantages:

- Decreases patient discomfort by reducing needle sticks
- Increases clinician safety through reduction of needle usage
- Easily added to an existing IV port
- Provides manufacturer with a new value added product
-  Incorporates existing materials for simplifying manufacturing"," Medical Device","http://www.partners.org/techtransfer/availabletechnologies/default.asp","Mary Auge, mauge@partners.org, 617-954-9395","Massachusetts General Hospital"

The “Peli System” of field expansion (the simultaneous seen field is larger with the device) involves a monocular sector prism that expends the field via peripheral diplopia and confusion. The new system shifts the field expansion property of peripheral prisms from the upper and lower peripheral visual fields toward the central visual field while maintaining the lateral field expansion.

"3553","Licensable Technology","Permanently charged ion channel blockers as anti-inflammatory and asthma therapeutic agents","Bean, Bruce P.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Whether applied with sodium channel blockers or calcium channel blockers, this approach can be used to treat multiple cutaneous or mucosal inflammatory conditions, including arthritis, colitis, gastritis, proctitis, conjuctivitus, urethritis, cystitis, rhinitis, asthma, and cough.Drugs can be administered topically, by injection, inhalation, orally, and by other means.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Inflammation has two components; one mediated by immune cells and one mediated by the nervous system, which is termed neurogenic inflammation. Neurogenic inflammation results from an efferent (motor) action of peptidergic nociceptor sensory neurons in contrast to their afferent (sensory) function. The afferent, sensory function of nociceptors, results from transduction of external stimuli and conduction of action potential from the periphery to the CNS to cause pain and reflex withdrawal. The efferent, motor function of nociceptors results from the release of neuropeptides and other chemicals from their peripheral terminals when activated. This release is much like neurotransmitter release, and is mediated by depolarization of the nociceptor's peripheral ending by voltage-gated sodium channels leading to calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels, and exocytosis of vesicles (See Figure 1 below).Release of neuropeptides can have multiple effects. It can lead to enhanced capillary permeability leading to edema, elicit pro-inflammatory reactions and recruitment of immune cells, cause vasodilation, and also propagate further afferent and efferent function by stimulating neighboring cells.Neurogenic inflammation contributes to the peripheral inflammation elicited by tissue injury, autoimmune diseases, infection, exposure to irritants, and other stimuli in soft tissue, skin, the respiratory system, joints, the GI tract, brain, and other tissues and has been proposed to have an important role in arthritis, rhinitis, gastritis, and colitis. Recent data point to a central role of neurogenic inflammation in allergic airway inflammation and Crohn’s disease.Drs. Bean and Woolf have tested and shown ways to reduce neurogenic inflammation. One way is to selectively block electrical excitation in nociceptors to prevent activation of peripheral terminals and subsequently the release of pro-inflammatory mediators (see Fig. 2). This can be done using sodium channel blocking agents such as local anesthetic agents, but the down side is that they are non-selective, have a relatively short duration of action, and will cause a block in all sensory and motor fibers. The invention is a targeted approach, using permanently charged sodiumchannel blockers that do not normally permeate the membrane, but can enter cells via large pore ion channels such as TRPV1 and TRPA1. These channels are selectively localized on nociceptors, in preference to ottypes of neurons. Cellular permanently charged sodium channel blockers can be facilitated using an agonist that opens the large ionic pores, allowing the blocker to work intracellularly, eliminating sodium currents and thereby reducing neurogenic inflammation. To achieve this, a combination of a large pore ion channel agonist (such as lidocaine) and a permanently charged sodium channel blocker is required and exposure to the permanently charged sodium channel blocker alone will have no effect.During active inflammation, however, many large pore ion channels are opened by multiple endogenous activators, and the permanently charged sodium channel blocker can be administered alone to treat neurogenic inflammation.Both TRPA1 and TRPV1 are important for the perception of airway irritation and cough and promote asthmatic inflammation after inhaled allergen challenges, leading to cough, mucus production, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and immune cell infiltration. Blocking only one of these two TRP channels would leave the other available to induce reflexes and neurogenic inflammation in response to thermal, chemical or immune stimuli. A strategy that can block both the TRPA1- and TRPV1-mediated contributions to airways inflammation, and thereby eliminate the sensory neuronal component of asthma should be superior to TRPA1 or TRPV1 antagonists or neuropeptide antagonists. Targeting sodium channel blockers selectively into respiratory sensory fibers should achieve this. One aspect of the invention of Bean and Woolf is inhalation of permanently charged blockers for this purpose. For Crohns’ disease and other mucosal inflammatory diseases of the GIT, oral administration of the blocker should suffice since the hydrophilic drugs will not be absorbed.A second way to reduce neurogenic inflammation is to block calcium entry through voltage-dependent calcium channels. Calcium entry is also important for the release of the neuropeptides/pro-inflammatory mediators. Membrane-impermeant versions of calcium channel-blocking drugs are normally inactive when applied outside the cell. However, Bean and Woolf have found that they can gain access into neurons by passing through large pore ion channels, similarly to that mentioned above."," Therapeutics - Methods","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3553","Michal Preminger, (617) 432-0920","Harvard University"

"3836","Licensable Technology","Phaeobacticides - Potent and selective new class of algae growth inhibitors","Clardy, Jon","MARKETS ADDRESSED:The invention addresses the need for a low-toxicity anti-algae agent that can be used in a variety of settings:•  Preventing algal growth in bodies of water: Algal blooms, if left unchecked can multiply to the point of rendering the water unfit for human use. The “pond moss”, greenish mats on the water surface can serve as the source of toxins, as well as physically block fish gills, fishing nets and water supply systems. As outlined above, most of the currently used algicides are non-specific chemicals, while phaeobacticides are the unique example of a natural product optimized to specifically target algae cells. The approach used by researchers in Clardy and Kolter laboratories can be extended to other bacterial strains and algae species resulting in a panel of phaeobacticides with different specificities. Also, phaeobacticides can be used in a combination with fungicides and bactericides. Such combinations might be less toxic and more efficient towards resistant pathogens. •  Algae-resistant materials: Being stable small molecules, phaeobacticides can be easily incorporated into a variety of materials or industrial products which are in prolonged contact with water. Few examples include fishing nets, swimming pool plastic coating, exterior paints, and synthetic resin renderings for heat protection.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Algae are a diverse group of uni- and multicellular plants that grow in water. Undesired and uncontrolled algal blooms are a recurring problem in bodies of water such as swimming pools, aquaculture ponds, aquariums, industrial drainage systems and even the ocean. Various strategies have been used to control algal growth – previous attempts to solve the problem included the use of active chlorine, copper-containing compounds or quaternary ammonium salts. Most of these approaches have severe drawbacks, and chemicals that are commonly used can be toxic, corrosive, decompose readily and precipitate in hard water. Hence, the need for safer algicides remains.Algal-bacterial symbiosis:  Eukaryotes, including algae, evolved on the planet teeming with bacteria and close associations between eukaryotes and bacteria are common. Microscopic algae, in particular, co-exist symbiotically with bacteria of the roseobacter clade. Bacterial metabolites can serve as antibiotics and auxins, which suppress the growth of potentially parasitic bacteria and promote algal growth, respectively. The algae, in turn, contribute a suitable surface for roseobacter to colonize. In some cases, as the algae die, the bacteria switch from being a mutualist to a pathogen. Phaeobacticides – a new class of potent phytotoxins:  Researchers in the Clardy and Kolter laboratories have discovered that a small molecule generated by compromised algae induces the roseobacter species to produce potent but selective phytotoxins.  The researchers hypothesized that the initiator of the mutualist-to-pathogen switch would be produced by compromised algae – as algae senesce, their cell walls deteriorate and breakdown products are released into the surrounding medium.  They therefore used a breakdown product of a component of the cell wall as a tool to study the response of three roseobacter strains to a compromised algal host.  Culturing one specific strain with this breakdown product stimulated the production of a family of compounds that were not produced in the absence of the breakdown product.  Two of these compounds, phaeobacticides A and B, were purified and further characterized: •  Phaeobacticides form a new class of compounds: Researchers used a combination of analytical techniques – mass-spectrometry, x-ray crystallography and magnetic resonance to elucidate the small molecule structures of these compounds. Compounds A and B are structurally similar, and have no close relatives among known natural products or synthetic molecules. Very recent work has expanded the family of known molecules to over a dozen.•  Phaeobacticides are potent phytotoxins: Algicidic activity of the two small molecules was measured against a panel of algae species. In several cases, the compounds were highly active – for example, the IC50 of phaeobacticides A and B against two common algae species was in the 0.1-0.2 µM range. In many cases algal cell lysis was observed after 24 hrs with cellular damage visible after 12 hrs. •  The small molecules are selective: No antibacterial activity was observed at concentrations up to 0.16 mM and some algae species were less susceptible to the compounds. Taken together, the facts suggest that phaeobacticides are not generally toxic and can selectively impair particular species, an important advantage over some of the currently used chemicals."," Foods and Plant Sciences  |   Biomaterials  |   Foods and Plant Sciences","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3836","Michal Preminger, (617) 432-0920","Harvard University"

Light energy may be delivered by fiber optic stimulation of specific brain regions at specific times.•     Local application of a caged neuropeptide on or in the skin to control pain and/or inflammation. Light energy may be delivered via UV lamp to activate the peptide.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Background: Neuropeptides have profound and complex neuromodulatory effects on neuronal function in the mammalian nervous system. Neuropeptides, including Orexins, Leptin, Ghrelin and Neuropeptide Y, regulate sleep, appetite and energy metabolism.  A number of drugs that target peptide receptors are used therapeutically for the treatment of disease.  Despite their importance in human biology and disease, there is a poor understanding of how neuropeptide signaling regulates synapses and brain circuits.  Studies into neuropeptide systems have been limited by a lack of experimental tools.  Due to their large size and hydrophobicity, acute administration of neuropeptides in brain tissue produces a slowly rising, prolonged and spatially imprecise presentation of peptide with poor control over concentration.  This can lead to aberrant receptor desensitization and hinders biophysical studies in intact tissue preparations.Development of photoactivatable neuropeptides: To enable delivery of neuropeptides with micron-scale resolution, the Sabatini laboratory developed photoactivatable neuropeptides. The compounds are comprised of a neuropeptide agonist linked to a chemical group forming a cage structure that blocks the activity of the peptide.  Exposure to UV light cleaves the caging structure and releases the neuropeptide agonist. Building on known pharmacology, the lab designed several candidate caged analogues of Leu- Enkephalin, a member of the opioid family of neuropeptides which is selective for the Delta and Mu opioid receptor subtypes. Dose-response relationships identified caged analogues that exhibited >100 fold reductions in potency with respect to Leu-Enkephalin at both Mu and Delta receptors with no activity at Kappa receptors. For each analogue, photolysis was studied using UV/VIS spectroscopy, HPLC and mass spectrometry. Preliminary electrophysiological evaluation was carried out on inhibitory neurons in mouse hippocampal slices, the predominant cells expressing Mu and Delta opioid receptors in the CA1 region.  Their findings indicate that CYLE, one of the caged neuropeptides, demonstrates:•  Photorelease of L-Enk: HPLC chromatograms of CYLE before and after exposure to UV light reveal photoconversion to L-Enk.•  High spatial resolution: CYLE rapidly and efficiently photoreleases L-Enk in brain tissue with ~100 µm spatial resolution.  •  High temporal resolution: Because microsecond flashes of light can be delivered on the scale of single synapses with millisecond kinetics, neuropeptides can be released on the timescale of vesicular fusion with sub-cellular spatial precision.  •  Graded delivery of L-Enk: Importantly, the concentration of released peptide is easily regulated by varying light intensity."," Research Tools","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3538","Michal Preminger, (617) 432-0920","Harvard University"

The Kim lab at Boston Children’s Hospital established an in vitro screening method to identify factors secreted by stromal cells (lymph node fibroblasts) that promote lung cancer metastasis and identified BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) as novel factor critical for the migration of lung cancer cells. TrkB (Trophomyosin-related kinase B) signaling, which is activated by BDNF, was further determined to be important for the in vitro and in vivo migration and metastases of NSCLC cells.

In addition, it was established that Polyamines can synergize with D-amino acids in blocking biofilm formation of those pathogens."," Therapeutics - Drugs","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=4090","Michal Preminger, (617) 432-0920","Harvard University"

Theoretical and experimental efforts in this area have been concentrated mainly on one of the basic cryptographic techniques, namely key distribution. Conventional cryptography provides no tools to guarantee the security of the key distribution. Any encoding by means of classical objects is vulnerable to passive interception.Quantum cryptography cannot prevent eavesdropping, but any eavesdropping attempt can be detected by the legitimate users of the communication channel. This is because eavesdropping affects the quantum state of the information carriers and results in an abnormal error rate. This invention describes the simplest quantum-cryptographical system based on two non-orthogonal states, from the point of view of its robustness to various eavesdropping strategies. In particular, two types or eavesdropping are compared, translucent eavesdropping and opaque eavesdropping, where translucent and opaque refer to the transmitted photons.

"3438","Licensable Technology","Potent OGT inhibitors for the treatment of cancer and diabetic complications","Walker Kahne, Suzanne","MARKETS ADDRESSED:OGT- An essential enzyme for nutrient sensing and regulating cellular siegnaling pathwaysThe ability to sense and respond to nutrient levels is critical for the growth of all living systems. In eukaryotes, a major mechanism for nutrient sensing involves the essential protein glycosyltransferase OGT, which senses cellular glucose levels via UDP-GlcNAc concentrations, and responds by dynamically O-GlcNAcylating a wide range of proteins including numerous transcription factors, tumor suppressors, kinases, phosphatase and histone-modifying proteins. OGT catalyses the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) to serines and threonines of protein sites. As many known O-GlcNAcylation sites are also phosphorylation sites, OGT is proposed to play a major role in modulating cellular kinase signaling cascades. OGT is also involved in widespread transcriptional regulation. Prolonged hyperglycaemia, such as occurs in diabetes, or excessive glucose uptake, such as occurs in cancer cells, results in hyper-O-GlcNAcylation of cellular proteins by OGT, and this increased O-GlcNAcylation has been linked to harmful cellular effects. Aberrant glycosylation by OGT has been linked to insulin resistance, diabetic complications, cancers and neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s. Thus, strategies to modulate OGT activity may have therapeutic value for treating diabetic complications, cancer, and other diseases.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:First-in-class and potent OGT inhibitorsThe Walker group has developed novel high throughput assays (HTS) and screened 200,000 compounds at the Institute for Chemistry and Cell Biology (ICCB) at Harvard Medical School, and identified several compound classes/cores that have the properties of OGT inhibitors. To identify other prospective leads, the scientists have evaluated 1400 commercially available compounds containing selected cores for improved OGT inhibition in vitro. So far, the Walker group has identified cell-permeable OGT inhibitors with IC50 values in 1-2 micromolar range, a 50-fold improvement over the original hits. Importantly, the Walker group possesses SAR data and several co-crystal structures of human OGT to guide the design of additional novel compounds. O-GlcNAcation and breast cancerWalker and collaborators have discovered a link between OGT and cancer cell growth and invasion (Caldwell et al., 2010). They demonstrated that OGT and O-GlcNAc levels are elevated in breast cancer cells. Also, they showed that OGT inhibitor (OGTi) reduces O-GlcNAcation and blocks growth and invasion of MCF-10A-ErbB2 cells in vitro.O-GlcNAcation, PI3K/Akt signaling and insulin resistanceIn a landmark study in 2008, Evans and coworkers reported a new mechanism of regulation of OGT. They discovered a unique binding site for phosphatidylinositol(3,4,5)trisphosphate (PIP3) that mapped to the C-terminus of OGT.  PIP3 is important in several signaling cascades, serving as a second messenger. It was shown that upon insulin stimulation, PIP3 binds to OGT, recruiting it to the plasma membrane. OGT then decorates insulin signaling pathway proteins with sugars, impeding their activity and dampening the insulin response. One of such examples is the inhibition of insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of AktThr308. Overexpression of OGT in the liver of mice causes insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia. Abnormal O-GlcNAc modification of insulin signaling may therefore contribute to insulin resistance, obesity and type-2 diabetes.Crystal structures of human OGTIn 2011, the Walker group reported two crystal structures of human OGT, as a binary complex with UDP (2.8Å resolution; referred to as OGT–UDP) and as a ternary complex with UDP and a well-characterized 14-residue CKII peptide substrate (1.95Å; referred to as OGT–UDP–peptide). The structures provide clues to the enzyme mechanism, show how OGT recognizes target peptide sequences, and reveal the fold of the unique domain between the two halves of the catalytic region.Currently under study is a third crystal structure, a co-crystal of a lead OGT inhibitor and human OGT. The data show that the compound inhibits human O-GlcNAc transferase by an unprecedented mechanism.The structure information will accelerate the rational design of biological experiments to investigate OGT’s functions. It will also help the design of inhibitors for use as cellular probes and help to assess its potential as a therapeutic target."," Therapeutics - Drugs  |   Research Tools","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3438","Vivian Berlin, (617) 496-0474","Harvard University"

Restoring the BBB by enhancing expression or adding protein might have a beneficial therapeutic effect in the progression of these conditions.Work is currently underway to further test the utility of the protein as an attractive target for modulating the BBB and we invite discussions for industry sponsored research alliances.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:The Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) has always been considered an obstacle for drug delivery to the brain. In addition, BBB breakdown is observed in many neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, it is important to find strategies to be able to transiently open the BBB for drug delivery, and repair BBB in the case of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s,  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and multiple sclerosis.Protein composition of the tight junction complex between BBB endothelial cells resembles epithelial and endothelial tight junctions outside the CNS, yet the BBB tight junction complex function is in a much tighter manner to prevent drug delivery to the brain. However, what makes the BBB junction unique has not been clearly elucidated thus far.The Gu lab has developed a sensitive method to allow one to examine the onset of BBB formation during development, then perform an unbiased screen for BBB specific genes during that time window. They have identified and validated a set of genes that is expressed in CNS vasculature, but not in vasculature of other regions of the body.•     They have identified a key BBB transmembrane protein; in its absence the embryonic formation of the BBB is perturbed. This protein is specifically expressed in BBB cells starting in early development and is highly enriched in the adult BBB. •     By using a mouse knockout model for this protein, they have demonstrated that the embryonic BBB is no longer functional allowing material injected into the vasculature circulation to freely extravasate into the CNS. •     Knockout mice have enlarged ventricles resembling hydrocephalus in the first week after birth."," Therapeutics - Drugs  |   Therapeutics - Methods","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=4703","Michal Preminger, (617) 432-0920","Harvard University"

In general, there are practical and scaleable means available to make alpha-amino acids, natural or unnatural, of either enanatiomer, as chiral intermediates to make pharmaceuticals or catalysts.  However, there is a family of amino acids that are not accessible by existing methods.  This is the family of unnatural amino acids with bulky groups, such as aryl or quaternary alkyl groups, in the alpha-position.  A well known example is (R)(tert)–leucine.  This invention, from the lab of Eric Jacobsen,  provides, for the first time, a practical, scaleable method of making these optically pure unnatural amino acids that will provide a whole new set of intermediates for research and commercial use.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:The essence of the invention is new catalysts that are easier to make (3 steps) and work under conditions amenable to large scale production compared to the current state of the art.  They work by asymmetric catalysis of the Strecker synthesis to provide alpha-amino acids with bulky side groups in high yield and high enantiomeric excess.   The catalysts have one chiral center and the different enantiomers of the catalysts produce the different enantiomers of the resultant alpha-amino acids.   The new catalysts are robust and can be used with aqueous cyanide salts which results in a much safer and practical industrial synthesis compared with the present method which requires HCN."," Chemical Methods/Libraries  |   Therapeutics - Drugs  |   Chemistry  |   Therapeutics - Drugs","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3572","Mick Sawka, (617) 496-3830","Harvard University"

The most serious long-term effect of diabetic nephropathy is kidney failure leading to end stage renal disease (ESRD), a condition in which there is a permanent and almost complete loss of kidney function. Other causes of ESRD include high blood pressure, glomerulonephritis, polycystic kidneys, and multiple myeloma. The invention is based on the inventors’ discovery that declining renal function can be detected far earlier than has previously been suspected. The inventors have found that the expression profile of certain proteins can predict a decline in renal function in a subject before the subject exhibits any overt symptom of renal disease. The invention features a method of evaluating a patient to determine predisposition to renal disease (e.g., end stage renal disease or diabetic nephropathy), as well as the presence or severity of the disease, by measuring expression of specific proteins. Such a diagnostic test would be valuable in that it would allow identification of patients at risk for ESRD far earlier than is now possible, perhaps making it feasible to screen a large proportion of individuals with Type 1 diabetes.

The first technique uses solely Sn/Ag nanosolder balls to replace the micron-sized solder balls previously used in industry. These nanosolder balls are mixed with flux and can be applied directly to micro- and nano-electronic assembly. The second technique involves using the synthesized Sn/Ag as well as tin, silver and copper (SAC) nanosolders as an additive to a microsolder paste of the same composition respectively. The nano and microsolders are then mixed together with a flux to create a uniform paste and are then applied to joints in the microelectronic assembly process.

A team of researchers, led by Prof. Lieber have invented a hybrid nanoscale device/system, to record the features of intracellular potential changes in living cells. This nanoscale device/system can be integrated into existing electrophysiology instruments, to be applied to fundamental studies of intracellular electrophysiological processes.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:The hybrid nanoscale system developed by Prof. Lieber’s team provides a unique approach for recording intracellular electrical signals. The system consists of a hollow nanotube, which serves as a probe, and a Si nanowire based field-effect transistor (FET), which serves as a signal convertor and collector. The small 50~100 nm nanotube probe introduces only negligible invasiveness to the cell during a measurement. The electrical potential signal produced by a living cell is captured and transmitted by the nanotube, and then the potential signal is converted into a current or a conductance signal by the nanoscale FET, which is in direct contact with the other end of the nanotube. Compared with the original potential signal, the converted current/conductance signal is much less likely to be interfered by the environment, and therefore, the measurement is much more reliable and reproducible. A demonstration on a living cardiomyocyte cell successfully showed this technology’s capability of capturing detailed features of an intracellular action potential change from inside the cell. In addition, the nanocale system is proven to be responsive enough  to capture a potential change occurring within 0.1 micro-seconds without any lag."," Instrumentation  |   Nanotechnology/NEMS","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=4179","Mick Sawka, (617) 496-3830","Harvard University"

Then an epitaxial layer of GaN can be grown by a hydride vapor phase epitaxial process on the pretreated substrate. The growth substrate can include a plane of mechanical weakness that is parallel with a predominant nitride growth surface of the substrate, and that is either inherently exhibited by the substrate or that is produced by processing of the substrate.

These conjugates are designed to penetrate the BBB and combat Gram-positive bacterial infections of the brain and CNS while eliminating the risks and complications associated with conventional pharmaceutical treatments."," Nanotechnology/NEMS  |   Plastics and Polymers Engineering  |   Research Tools  |   Plastics and Polymers Engineering","http://www.umass.edu/research/available-technologies/protein-conjugates-antimicrobial-drugs-treating-infections-central-nervous-sy","Office of Commercial Ventures and Intellectual Property Phone: 413-545-3606   E-Mail: cvip@research.umass.edu","University of Massachusetts at  Amherst"
"JDP-066","Licensable Technology","Protein Kinase C Monocyte Assay","George Liang King, M.D.","Recent studies have shown that hyperglycemia induces de novo diacylglycerol synthesis and activates Protein Kinase C (PKC), which leads to many kinds of vascular abnormalities (e.g. abnormalities of the retina or cardiovascular tissues). A means to measure PKC activity in vascular tissues is desired, but such samples are not easy to repeatedly obtain, especially from diabetic patients. The invention stems from the discovery that PKC activity in vascular tissues is correlated with PKC activity in mononuclear cells (monocytes). In addition, the inventor has discovered that PKC activity is correlated with aging and the severity of diabetic complications. Because monocytes are easy to obtain from patients, this allows a simple diagnostic test that would allow the diagnosis or monitoring of disease progress in a variety of vascular tissues. The invention provides a simple, easy to use, clinical assay in which the presence, extent or severity of various disorders can be evaluated. Among the disorders to which this assay may be applicable are diabetes, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic nephropathy, renal failure, hypertension, atherosclerosis and a number of cardiovascular disorders such as cardiomyopathy. The assay can be used either to diagnose a susceptibility to any of these conditions, or for monitoring the progress of such a condition once the patient has been diagnosed and has begun treatment."," Diagnostics/Biomarkers","http://www.joslinresearch.org/inventions","David J.

The Silver lab is interested in identifying bipartite therapeutics for a number of indications including anemia, asthma, and RA and is interested in accessing additional resources to support these efforts.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:A bipartite, quantitatively designed protein having two discrete ligands and a linker; one ligand having the ability to strongly bind to a particular cell, the other having the ability to affect a target only when the previous ligand binds.For many years, researchers have tried to construct bipartite proteins with properties that derive from each moieties parental source.  A universal problem with this kind of approach is that the likelihood of off-target effects as the drug travels through the body is high.  Because reaction rates are often enhanced by reduction of space between two substrates, researchers thought that an initial rapid binding reaction to one cell surface protein could drive a second, weak interaction on the same cell surface, driven solely by reduction in space.  It is believed that it is possible to tune the binding affinities of both the targeting agent and the activating ligand appropriately, allowing the development of a mutant protein that would show negligible activation on cells expressing just one of the relevant receptors.  Proof of principle has been demonstrated using EGF as the targeting agent and IFN?-2a as the ligand and research continues using the same technology for the development of bipartite haemopoietic, asthma, and HIV therapeutics."," ","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=2911","Karen Sinclair, (617) 495-3067","Harvard University"

In this technique, the high affinity of metal ions such as nickel or cobalt to a tag sequence on the protein of interest creates strong yet reversible binding.  A major limitation of current systems is their inefficiency in purifying many recombinant proteins, particularly when present in their native state or in low concentrations in the cell lysate.  Performance deficiencies are caused in part by the clogging or destruction of matrix micropores by undissolved salts and other compounds during particle synthesis, limiting the surface area accessible for binding.  Low surface metal density can further impair efficiency. ||
The current invention is a straightforward synthetic scheme to produce microgel particles where the metal-chelating moiety, nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), is distributed throughout the entire matrix.  This new type of microgel particle is characterized by higher nickel density (inside and on the surface) than conventional beads leading to a very large area of exposure.  The gels aim to overcome the deficiencies of current methods by eliminating a separate coating step, hence reducing the clogging of matrix pores during synthesis, and by further improving the efficiency of his-tagged protein purification by enhancing the penetration of proteins into the matrix while presenting a high density of metal ions."," Research Tools  |   Research Tools  |   Research Tools","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=2109","Khunkhun, Rajinder, rajinder.khunkhun@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"

It aims to: (1) optimize the production process to reduce the number of defective parts produced, and (2) prevent the distribution of defective products to the customer. Typical categories of QC include static (electromechanical), dynamic (servohydraulic), hardness and impact testing, as well as dimension and shape inspection. The latter is typically performed manually or by coordinate measuring machines, which are often slow. Automation and speed improvement of dimension and shape inspection can reduce cost per piece examined and, in turn, improve QC by increasing inspection rate. This is especially critical for injection-molded plastic parts arts, where cost per piece is low.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Magnetic levitation (MagLev) allows suspension of diamagnetic objects in a paramagnetic fluid by application of a magnetic field gradient. The levitation height and three-dimensional orientation of an immersed object with respect to the gradient sensitively depends on its density, shape, and distribution of density. As such, MagLev is well suited for automated and contactless dimension and shape inspection as part of a QC process. We demonstrated MagLev’s sensitivity and specificity for various injection-molded plastic parts of complex shape (e.g., screws)."," Manufacturing  |   Mechanical Engineering  |   Manufacturing  |   Plastics and Polymers Engineering","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3969","Mick Sawka, (617) 496-3830","Harvard University"
"642","Licensable Technology","Quantities of Peptide/MHC Complexes on Antigen Presenting Cells","Nadler, L","Cellular vaccines hold promise for new, powerful therapies against tumor cells, intracellular parasites, and viral infections. Cellular vaccine immunization relies upon an antigen presenting cell (APC) that has been ""pulsed"" with an antigen; APCs stimulate T cells specific for a particular antigen by presenting the antigen, or a peptide of the antigen, on the surface of the APC in a complex with a major histocompatibility complex protein (MHC). Efficacious therapies depend upon APCs that present antigen/MHC complexes in amounts that induce optimal T cell responses. The invention provides a method for determining the density of specific molecules on the surface of APCs, including MHC class I and class II, and adhesion and costimulatory molecules (such as CD54, CD58, CD80, and CD86). Methods provided by the invention allow one to determine the absolute number of these molecules, and the ratio of these molecules to the cell surface area. The methods featured by this invention involve a set of reagents; the invention provides a kit that includes these reagents to facilitate the calculation of MHC/ peptide complex density.

Applications/Advantages: As mentioned above, cellular vaccines depend upon APCs which present sufficient antigen/ MHC complex to induce a T cell response. Accordingly, the invention includes a method for determining whether an APC has a sufficient cell surface density of MHC/peptide complex for use in therapy. This technology is also useful for identifying conditions that enhance the therapeutic quality of antigen-pulsed APCs. For example, one can identify an agent that maximizes the length of time that a peptide-MHC complex persists on the surface of a cell using the methods of the invention. This technology facilitates rapid optimization of cellular vaccines for translation from the bench to the clinic."," Research Reagents","http://www.dfci.harvard.edu/res/technology/available.asp?case_number=642&keywords=&category_id=3&category_name=Research+Reagents","Ruth Emyanitoff, Phone (617) 632-4010, Fax (617) 632-4012, Email Ruth_Emyanitoff@dfci.harvard.edu","Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"

Regardless of specific etiology, it has been found that dopaminergic neurons in the A9 region of the brain (substantia nigra pars compacta) are considerably more vulnerable than dopaminergic neurons in the immediately adjacent A10 region (ventral tegmental area). It is likely that different gene products expressed in the A10 neurons provide a neuroprotective effect. Based on extensive gene expression studies comparing A9 and A10 neurons, the inventors have discovered that elevated levels of the protein Rab3B are neuroprotective of dopaminergic neurons. Rab3B overexpression in A9 neurons of rodents caused an increase in the striatal dopamine content and in the expression levels of certain Rab3 effector proteins, resulting in significant neuroprotection of the A9 neurons.
     Potential Commercial Uses: This invention features methods for the treatment or prevention of PD by increasing the expression or activity of Rab3B (e.g. introducing Rab3B protein or nucleic acid into the A9 region of the brain).  By identifying a novel target for PD, this invention will lead to safer, more specific, and more powerful treatments for PD, which would be of great importance given the prevalence of this disease in our aging populations. Current therapy for PD, such as the use of the dopamine precursor L-DOPA to replace brain dopamine, has had only limited effectiveness.

"22424","Licensable Technology","Radiolabeling Feraheme for Imaging Macrophage Activity","Josephson, Lee ; Holland, Jason Philip","Technology: 
Macrophage activity is an important indicator of the normal function of the major organs of the reticuloendothelial system (e.g. liver, spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow). In disease, important abnormal sites of macrophage activity include tumors, inflammatory lesions, heart attack lesions, stroke lesions, and major vessel atherosclerotic plaque. One nanoparticle, Feraheme (ferumoxytol), is an iron oxide approved for the treatment of iron anemia that can be used to image macrophage function with MRI. However, MR imaging with Feraheme requires high doses and cannot be used to visualize tissues with weak macrophage activity. The inventors have developed a new method for radiolabeling Feraheme and other iron oxide nanoparticles for use in PET or SPECT imaging, which allows for quantitative imaging of macrophage activity with significantly lower dosage. The new radiolabeling method is simple, is applicable to any radiolabel, and yields a radiolabeled nanoparticle that is physically and chemically identical to the unlabeled nanoparticle, potentially saving millions of dollars in regulatory costs.

Applications: 
- PET imaging of tumor-associated macrophages, which are indicative of tumor maintenance, aggression, and metastases. 
- MR/PET imaging for quantitative determination of lymph node metastatic status. 
- Image-guided tumor therapy using Feraheme radiolabeled with therapeutic metal ions, which kill macrophages (directly) or tumor cells (through proximal effects).

Advantages:
- Radiolabeling methods yield an imaging agent that is physically identical to Feraheme, an approved drug with a long history of clinical use.
- Radiolabeling methods are simple, inexpensive, can be used with any radiolabel, and are broadly applicable to a variety of nanoparticles.
- PET or SPECT imaging with Feraheme enables quantitative imaging of macrophage activity with significantly lower doses than with MR imaging."," Medical Imaging","http://www.partners.org/techtransfer/availabletechnologies/default.asp","Rebecca Listfield, rlistfield@partners.org, 617-954-9387","Massachusetts General Hospital"

The system does this by engaging subjects in an emotionally activating video game that requires their focused attention. While playing, the game provides biofeedback about the players' level of calm. It also gives them feedback on how well they are focusing and performing in the game. ||

An external probe measures biometrics (e.g. heart rate) as a real-time input into a computer game. The system's biofeedback mechanism then alters parameters in the game so that individuals succeed better in the game if they are calmer. The objectives of the game become harder to achieve as the individual's stress rises (e.g. the player becomes weaker or is less protected), inducing a type of feedback loop. To succeed in the game, players must achieve calm and focused attention simultaneously while in stressful situations. ||

The RAGE control video game has been validated and new, physical toys (Biological Manipulatives) and game systems are under development.

The tumors eventually begin to slowly regress over 1 to 7 years, but this period of involution and its extent are extremely variable. Most hemangiomas do not regress to an acceptable cosmetic level on their own. They occur most often in the head and neck region but they may occur anywhere on the skin or internal organs, and can lead to cardiac failure, hemorrhage and jaundice in addition to disfigurement. Dr. Bischoff's lab developed unique patient-derived cellular and animal models of IH in collaboration with BCH's Vascular Anomalies Center, the largest center of its kind in the world. With these assays, Dr. Bischoff and colleagues carried out a screen for FDA-approved drugs that could serve as novel treatments for IH.

This invention is based upon the discovery that FANCD2-containg foci are formed in cells in response to genotoxic agents (agents which cause DNA damage).  Further, foci formation is correlated with the degree of exposure.                                  Applications/Advantages:Efforts to predict which cancer patients have an underlying DNA repair disorder have been largely ineffectual.

The laboratory of Tayyaba Hasan at the Wellman Center for Photomedicine is developing a diagnostic test (using novel photoactivatable compositions synthesized in the lab) that can be used for the quantitative detection and functional definition of beta-lactamase activity in a patient sample.  Beta-lactamases are a wide spread drug resistance mechanism used by bacteria including the Extended Spectrum Beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Gram-negative bacterial pathogens that are notoriously difficult to treat successfully. The test can be performed by adding a patient sample (such as fluid from an abscess) to a microwell plate containing the beta-lactamase-activated fluorescent probe. The result is fluorometric (thus enabling a quantitative measurement of beta-lactamase activity over time) and when performed can be read on any standard fluorescence microplate reader.  The test can also be performed in the presence of a competitive substrate to beta-lactamase, providing a method to type the beta-lactamase enzyme in the patient sample.  This information can guide a physician to recommend an appropriate antibiotic therapy for a patient instead of defaulting to prescribing a broad spectrum antibiotic, a practice that has led to much of the antimicrobial drug resistance prevalent today.
 
Applications: 
-Clinical detection of a specific antibacterial resistant bacteria in patient samples                      -Tailored antibiotic treatment for a patient?s particular infection

Advantages:		
-Test is adaptable in any laboratory setting (results can be analyzed in any existing fluorescence microplate reader; does not require new capital equipment)
-Highly sensitive and rapid diagnostic test (result in 20 minutes as compared to 20 hours for conventional test)
-Bacterial sample can be applied directly and assayed, does not require overnight culture
-Test enables precise treatment of an infection with an appropriate antibiotic as opposed to defaulting to prescribing a broad-spectrum antibiotic
-Test minimizes further antibiotic resistance	
-For hospitalized patients, decreases length of hospital stays and healthcare costs associated with prolonged hospitalization

"224","Licensable Technology","Reactive, Neutralizing Human Anti-gp120 Recombinant Antibody","Haseltine, W","The first step in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is the specific binding of HIV?s gp120 protein (an envelope glycoprotein) to its cellular receptor on human cells, the CD4 molecule. Serum antibodies can neutralize viral infection by binding to several different sites on the gp120 molecule. Antibodies directed to hypervariable regions of gp120 are frequently strain-specific, allowing a fraction of viruses to escape neutralization. Antibodies that are capable of neutralizing a broad range of HIV isolates bind a discontinuous, well-conserved epitope on gp120 that encompasses the CD4 binding region. This invention takes advantage of this finding, and provides a broadly neutralizing recombinant monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds at or near the CD4 binding domain of gp120.

Applications/Advantages: The mAbs provided by this technology are directed toward the CD4 binding domain of gp120, making them useful for neutralizing a wide array of diverse HIV strains. To add to the anti-HIV arsenal, this technology provides these mAbs conjugated to a cytotoxic moiety. Likewise, the mAb may be conjugated to an enzyme that cleaves gp120 at the binding site.

Additional cells and cell lines comprising nucleic acids that encode one or more additional markers are also provided. According to certain of the inventive methods cells such as these are mutagenized, transfected or infected with a library of genetic suppressor elements, or contacted with a test compound. Cells in which RNAi is inhibited or activated are identified using an appropriate selective condition or screening method. The identity of the mutated or inhibited gene or the identity of the compound is then determined."," ","http://www.ipvisioninc.com/findurl.php?uid=mitDossier:10602","Lauren Foster","Massachusetts Institute of Technology"

Living cells specify lineage and express different phenotypic and physical states in respond to stretching forces. In particular, for cells that are found in heart, lung, muscle and gut, dynamic stretching is a potent biological stimulus. It has never been possible, however, to reproduce such mechanical microenvironment in a tissue culture system.The present invention is ready for automation and scale-up for high-throughput applications in cell cultures, stem cell therapy, drug discovery and traction microscopy.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Scientists at the Harvard School of Public Health have developed a novel system to realistically reproduce a cell's dynamic physical environment. The system consists of two components: (1) Bio-matrix stretcher (BMS): a ring-shaped punch-indentation system that can impose a uniform, uniaxial or biaxial, transient, tensile or compressive cell strain upon cells plated on tunable elastic substrates with tissue-like stiffness; and (2) Dynamic Traction Microscopy (DTM): a device for quantifying changes of cell-contractile forces in response to a stretch. Together, our system allows one to reproduce the mechanical microenvironments of various cell types, hence allowing scientists to study cell cultures in a physiological relevant manner."," Tissue Engineering  |   Tissue Engineering  |   Tissue Engineering","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=2983","Grant Zimmermann, (617) 495-3067","Harvard University"

Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) are critically involved in tyrosine phosphorylation; two conserved, intracellular phosphatase domains (D1 and D2) typify the receptor-type PTPases (RPTPases). This technology features methods for determining the three-dimensional structure of members of the RPTPase family. Accordingly, this invention provides the structure of the two domain Leukocyte Common Antigen Related D1/D2 protein (LAR). The invention also provides the structure of the cytoplasmic portion of CD45, the other prototypic member of the RPTPase family (in addition to LAR).

Applications/Advantages: Tyrosine phosphorylation is not only an essential part of signal transduction mediated by various growth factor receptors, but is also involved in intracellular signal transduction and nuclear cell cycle regulation. Disturbances of these processes are known to be causes of cancer. High quality crystallographic data reveals mechanistic information concerning tyrosine phosphorylation that in turn guides rational drug design. This technology provides the first high quality crystals and corresponding structural data concerning the membrane distal PTPase (D2) domain, and structures of the two consecutive PTPase domains within the same polypeptide chain.

Inadequate levels of a serine protease, adipsin, have been associated with obesity in mice. The present invention provides DNA encoding a human protein that has adipsin activity (human adipsin/D).  Interestingly, this protein also exhibits activity similar to complement D; since both adipsin and complement D are serine proteases, they would be expected to be homologous, not necessarily cross-reactive.   

Applications/Advantages: Although the murine adipsin gene has been obtained, the human gene has not; the insights obtained from murine metabolism prior to this invention have not been accessible for treatment of humans.  Accordingly, this invention provides gene sequences, peptides, antibodies, and associated methods to diagnose and control obesity in humans.  For example, one may determine if a subject is predisposed to obesity via diagnostic antibodies raised to human adipsin/D.  Such individuals are obese despite the ingestion of only a normal diet.  The dual action of the protein makes it useful also for the treatment of infection.  The complement D alternate pathway is involved in generating factors that stimulate macrophages to lyse infective agents such as bacteria, parasites, viruses, as well as neoplastic tissue.  Thus, this technology is useful in treating or preventing bacterial infections that are directly controlled by the alternate complement D branch of the complement cascade."," Research Reagents","http://www.dfci.harvard.edu/res/technology/available.asp?case_number=185&keywords=&category_id=3&category_name=Research+Reagents","Nancy Grodin, Phone (617) 632-5516, Fax (617) 632-4012, Email Nancy_Grodin@dfci.harvard.edu","Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"

Based upon a Michelson interferometer, the PI interferometer uses a 50/50 splitter and Faraday Rotator Mirrors (FM's). The interferometer achieves good optical characteristics, such as high extinction ratio (ER) and low insertion loss (IL). Lack of polarization sensitivity reduces interferometer construction tolerances and cost, enhances performance and utility, and expands the scope of interferometric based devices. Such characteristics can be used to construct flexible, high performance, polarization insensitive, multi-rate, self-calibrating, optical DPSK receivers, power combiners, optical filters and interleavers, all-optical switches, and cascaded interferometers. Since polarization is not maintained in standard fiber optic networks, a PI-DPSK receiver allows for use of more sensitive DPSK communications over fiber, without need for costly polarization control hardware.

To date, no bulk oxide or mixed oxide sorbent has been found that achieves the desired criteria for high reactivity, efficient H 2S removal and regenerability in cyclic operation. Desulfurization of fuel gases to the lowest possible levels is critical from an environmental and commercial standpoint because of the polluting impact of and governmental restrictions on the amount of sulfur released into the atmosphere from the combustion of coal.Desulfurization is as essential for the efficient, long term operation of fuel cells. Fuel cells continue to undergo rapid development for both stationary and transportation applications. Low-sulfur diesel, fuel oils and hydrogen are being contemplated for use with fuel cells domestically. For even low-sulfur fuels, however, there remains a pressing need for a sorbent unit capable of effectively removing H 2S upstream of the fuel cell anode to prevent sulfur poisoning and performance degradation. Moreover, for high temperature fuel cells, such as solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), a sorbent is needed with the additional capability to reliably perform cyclic operations with high structural stability at temperatures exceeding 600°C.Professor Maria Stephanopoulos and colleagues at Tufts University have developed a solution to these challenging problems. They have developed a novel regenerative cerium and lanthanum oxide based sorbent technology that employs a swing-adsorption/desorption process, whereby anode offgas is used to sweep desorbed H 2S to the burner that supplies heat to the fuel processor. This technology promises:   excellent sulfur removal efficiency (to <1ppm H 2S);   very fast adsorption of H 2S under high space velocities, allowing only the surface of the sorbent to sulfide;   regeneration (desorption of H 2S) in various gas streams at times comparable to the adsorption times;    a single, onboard sorber/regenerator pair configuration, enabling both small (<1L / 5kW) and large scale fuel cell power plants;   off-site regeneration design configurations through the use of removable sorbent cartridges;   a reversible process, with no irreversible structural complications, enabling long cycle lifetimes;   flexibility in regeneration (gas type and temperature);   good reactivity and stability at temperatures ranging 650-800 °C.Market Opportunity:Desulfurization for Portable Auxiliary Power Units (APUs), Fuel Cells Commercial prospects for using fuel cells as APUs are increasing. In the transportation sector, APUs can serve as range extenders for cars and small power/heating modules for trucks and refrigeration units. Employing APUs in large trucks to produce electricity and cabin heat instead of employing engine idling, for example, can reduce CO 2 emissions of 20-30 tons per year per truck according to a recent DOE calculation. At efficiencies approaching 50%, such APUs could dramatically reduce fuel consumption and cost as well. Common diesel (DF-2) fuel, however, contains impurities, particularly sulfur, that can poison the APU. The Tufts regenerative sorbent technology enables the creation of compact, commercially feasible systems for both onboard and removable cartridge based removal of the sulfur upstream of the APU.Additional portable APU markets that may benefit from onboard or removable cartridge based desulfurization include:  robust, fuel source tolerant portable electronics (mobile communications, computers, soldier power sources/equipment)  portable generators (home, light industry)  passenger transportation (bicycles, scooters, autos)   marine and underwater (boats, submarines)Desulfurization for Stationary Fuel Processing/Electricity Generation/Hydrogen ProductionGlobal reserves of fossil fuels are becoming increasingly “sour” with sulfur. The Tufts regenerable sorbent technology may be employed by companies and utilities in the large gas processing market, offering the refining, pipeline and terminal industries significant commercial and operational benefits to meet existing and future clean fuels regulations.This technology is particularly well suited to reducing pollutant emissions from coal gasification. Coal offers strong potential as an important fuel for traditional power generation in the US due to its secure supply and broad availability with large domestic reserves. The importance of coal is recognized by the government through the Clean Coal Initiative. By providing for an improved desulfurization treatment of coal gasification syngas at the desired elevated temperatures, this technology promises to improve overall efficiencies to meet Clean Coal Initiative goals. At the same time, this technology also serves to facilitate the generation of hydrogen to power fuel cells, as hydrogen is a major component of syngas. Desulfurization of the hydrogen allows for the production of ultra-pure hydrogen with only trace amounts of residual sulfur.Funding:To date, development of the Tufts regenerable sorbent technology has been funded by the Army Research Laboratory Collaborative Technology Alliance (CTA) on Power and Energy and the NASA Glenn Research Center. Given the source of research funding, initial focus has been centered on ensuring the flexibility of design, fuel and size parameters to meet key requirements for intended military power applications.Intellectual Property:US and foreign patent applications covering this technology are currently pending.

"JDP-025","Licensable Technology","Regulation of Eating Behavior","Eleftheria Maratos-Flier, M.D.","Melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) is a cyclic peptide found in fish and mammals. Although involved in regulation of color change in fish, it is localized in the ventral aspect of the Zona Incerta and the lateral hypothalamus in mammals, and was suspected to play a role in complex mammalian behaviors. This invention is based on the discovery that MCH regulates eating behavior in mammals. Specifically, MCH has been shown to stimulate feeding in rodents, while animals lacking the MCH gene are lean. The invention therefore comprises methods of using MCH or its analogs, agonists or antagonists to control weight gain or eating behavior.

"3785","Licensable Technology","Regulation of hypoxia and glycolysis through modulation of SIRT3 activity: SIRT3 activators for cancer metabolism and SIRT3 inhibitors for vascular disease","Haigis, Marcia C.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Pharmaceutical targeting of the SIRT3 activity may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment and/or prevention of cancer and vascular disease:•  SIRT 3 Activators for Solid tumors: The switch from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism is a hallmark of tumorigenesis.  Cancer cells preferentially perform aerobic glycolysis as a means to rapidly synthesize biomass essential for their growth.  This reprogramming is critical to cancer initiation and progression.  As demonstrated by authors, SIRT3 has tumor suppressive function and acts by destabilizing HIF1? and reducing the glycolytic metabolism. A small molecule, protein or gene therapeutic that upregulates SIRT3 would reduce the level of glycolytic metabolism and deprive solid tumors of energy, without significantly impacting healthy cells that rely mostly on the TCA cycle. •  SIRT3 Inhibitors for Stroke, myocardial infarction and peripheral vascular disease: These conditions are characterized by interruption of blood supply that leads to hypoxia and often cell death. Recovery of the damaged tissue takes a long time and, in most cases, is never complete. Inhibitors of SIRT3 could become a first-aid treatments for these conditions – downregulation of SIRT3 would increase glycolytic metabolism and allow cells in impacted tissues to survive longer, reducing the long-term tissue damage.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Glucose is a universal nutrient – almost any living cell generates energy by breaking it down. In cells, glucose is converted into two molecules of pyruvate, which are further metabolized in mitochondria by the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. This metabolic pathway provides the highest amount of energy, however it requires oxygen and is relatively slow. Sometimes oxygen is in short supply, for example, when the vascular system cannot deliver enough oxygen to satisfy needs of a rapidly contracting muscle.  Hypoxia is also a hallmark of aggressively growing tumors and vascular disease, such a stroke or myocardial infarction. Under hypoxic conditions, including these disease conditions, cells switch to glycolytic metabolism.  This metabolic pathway does not require oxygen and enables fast conversion of pyruvate into lactic acid to provide energy.While the fundamental mechanisms of these metabolic pathways have been described for decades, little is known about the regulation of the balance between oxidative and glycolytic metabolism. Mitochondrial metabolic enzymes are heavily acetylated, which hints that reversible deacetylation of mitochondrial enzymes could be involved in the regulation of metabolic reprogramming.Regulation of cellular metabolism:  Researchers in the Haigis laboratory discovered the first example of a mitochondrial-driven, reversible switch enabling cells to rapidly induce metabolic reprogramming. They found that SIRT3, a mitochondrial-localized member of the sirtuin family of NAD-dependent deacetylases which is known to regulate global mitochondrial acetylation, is a crucial regulator of the switch to aerobic glycolysis. This implies that SIRT3 can serve as an important therapeutic target that would enable switching between glycolytic and oxidative metabolism.  Several lines of evidence prove the clinically relevant connection between SIRT3 and cellular metabolism:•  SIRT3-null cells demonstrate a shift towards glycolytic metabolism. SIRT3 knock-out (KO) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) have faster glucose uptake, lower levels of TCA intermediates, higher levels of lactate and proliferate significantly faster than WT MEFs. In addition, the effects of SIRT3 deletion are similar to changes in metabolism caused by hypoxia.  Taken together, these data show that the loss of SIRT3 causes metabolic reprogramming and resembles the phenotype of a fast-growing solid tumor.•  SIRT3 destabilizes HIF1?, the primary driver of increased glycolysis. The investigators also conducted experiments to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the metabolic reprogramming. They demonstrate in MEFs that SIRT3 knock-out leads to stabilization of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF1?), in a manner similar to TCA cycle defects. •  Tumor suppressive function of SIRT3 is confirmed in vivo. Transformed SIRT3 WT and KO MEFs were infected into nude mice. Tumors formed from 64% of KO injections but only 27% of WT injections. In addition, tumors lacking SIRT3 grew faster and larger than in control experiments. These in vivo data show that SIRT3 loss promotes glucose uptake and provides a growth advantage for tumor cells."," Therapeutics - Drugs","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3785","Michal Preminger, (617) 432-0920","Harvard University"

Here we show that ablation of Akt1 inhibits, while ablation of Akt2 accelerates tumor induction by both transgenes. The tumors arising in mice lacking individual Akt isoforms exhibit distinct histologic phenotypes. Although all these tumors are locally invasive however, they differ in metastatic potential, with the Akt1.sup.-/- tumors being less metastatic. The development of the mammary gland during puberty and the expression of MMTV LTR-driven transgenes in Akt1, Akt2 and Akt3 knockout mice are normal. These data combined, indicate that ablation of individual Akt isoforms influences tumor induction by modulating oncogenic signaling induced by the two transgenes. Further studies revealed that the delay of tumor induction in Akt1 knockout mice is due to the inhibitory affects of Akt1 ablation on cell proliferation and cell survival. The results of the present study may have significant translational implications because they may influence how Akt inhibitors will be used in the treatment of human cancer."," Drug Discovery Tools","http://www.tufts.biz/cgi-bin/tech_search.cgi?r=1&case=TMC-351","John Cosmopoulos617-636-0366john.cosmopoulos@tufts.edu","Tufts Medical Center"

Antigen binding by T cell receptor initiates a signaling cascade necessary for T cell activation. Persistent T cell signaling, occurring in chronic infections and cancer, lead to the development of T cell exhaustion, a dysfunctional T cell state. Exhausted T Cells have compromised effector functions making them unable to clear infections and cancer. ||

Reinvigoration of T cells by inhibiting checkpoint receptors, such as CTLA4 or PD-1, are actively used in the clinic for cancer treatment. Although immune checkpoint blockades have a substantial clinical benefit, only half of the patients respond and many present immune-related adverse events and possibly relapse 2-3 years after treatment. Therefore, there is an unmet need for novel therapeutic approaches to reduce adverse events while increasing the efficacy of the treatment.||

 Dr. Winau and his team identified a lipid scramblase -TMEM16F- as a key regulator for protecting T cells, especially cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), from severe exhaustion during chronic viral infection. The team has shown that mice lacking TMEM16F completely fail to clear virus infection due to compromised T cell responses. These mice also showed a significant increase in expression of exhaustion markers, including PD-1, on CD8 cells. Dr. Winau proposes that targeted activation of TMEM16F may halt the development of T cell exhaustion and further promote virus clearance in chronic viral infections, such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and chronic hepatitis. While the same strategy alone may also function to clear cancer, combining targeted activation of TMEM16F alongside immune checkpoint therapies may serve as a synergistic therapeutic strategy."," Therapeutics - Drugs","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=3001","Dietz, Ryan, ryan.dietz@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"

The wavelength response at the output port of a ring resonator side coupled to two waveguides is determined by the details of the resonator, and the coupling between the resonator and the waveguides. By coupling to adjacent resonators, the modulator response can be improved over that of a single resonator. One such improvement is in modulator efficiency, which is defined as the ratio of the change in optical intensity at the output, to a change in absorption in the ring waveguides. Absorption is used for switching and modulation without incurring significant optical attenuation. Another improvement involves making the resonance insensitive to small deviations in wavelength or index change. The latter improves fabrication tolerances and compensates for possible drift of the signal wavelength.

"JDP-085","Licensable Technology","Retinal Imaging System","Joseph Zelvin and Sven-Erik Bursell, Ph.D.","The invention overcomes certain problems inherent in traditional systems for retinal imaging through pupils that have not undergone pharmacological dilation (mydriasis). This is of particular importance in teleophthalmology, where pupil dilation can be a barrier for retinal eye examinations, particularly in patients where natural pupil dilation in low ambient light is small. To reduce haze and glare in the image of the retina, it is necessary to keep the retinal illuminating rays largely separate from the central region of the crystalline lens of the eye through which the retina is observed. In some retinal imagers, the illuminating rays are in the form of a ring with a central hole through which the retinal observations are made. In others, the illuminating rays are concentrated into a single small circular region that is usually positioned at some point on the periphery of the pupil. Such methods do not work particularly well in patients whose pupils remain small. This invention provides a method for creating and delivering the ideal bundle of rays for a non-ring shaped illumination system to provide a high quality retinal image with a field of view comparable to that obtained when imaging through a pharmacologically dilated pupil. The invention also features other methods for reducing unwanted specular reflections in retinal imaging, and for stereoscopic imaging of the retina. The imaging system of the invention offers tangible advantages over existing ophthalmoscopes and retinal imaging systems for non-mydriatic imaging of the retina. Its specific advantage is in providing an improved imaging capability and retinal image quality for patients with small pupil dilation, less than 3.8 mm or even less than 2.5 mm, for which existing systems do not work particularly well. Individuals with diabetes, as well as many older patients, have such small pupil dilation. In addition, the device can be manufactured much less expensively than existing systems, is portable, and may therefore be more generally applicable for widespread use in retinal pathological assessment with many types of patients."," Diagnostics/Biomarkers","http://www.joslinresearch.org/inventions","David J.

The 600kDa subunit, microtubule-associated factor (MTAF) 600, interacts directly with RB and microtubules and plays a role in active repression of E2F-responsive genes, cell cycle arrest and genomic stability.

Applications/Advantages: Loss of RB binding to the E2(1-5) complex for an RB mutant can give rise to the tumor phenotype. The interaction between MTAF600 and the RB complex as well as the interaction between the RB complex and the E2(1-5) complex provides the basis for an assay that may be used to identify small molecules that can be used to manipulate the cell cycle to treat retinoblastoma and osteosarcoma, lung cancer, breast cancer and bladder cancer.

"236","Licensable Technology","Retinoblastoma-Associated Protein 1 cDNA","Kaelin, W","Researchers have discovered a nuclear protein in normal human cells called ?retinoblastoma-associated protein 1? (RBAP-1), also known as E2F-1.  Based on in vitro evidence, RBAP-1 binds directly to the retinoblastoma protein (RB) pocket of the under-phosphorylated form of RB and does not bind to phosphorylated RB or to RB with inactivating mutations.  The direct binding of RBAP-1 to RB suggests that RBAP-1 is involved in the RB signal transduction pathway.

Analysis of RBAP-1 gene expression in cell culture demonstrated that RBAP-1 is expressed primarily during S phase of the cell cycle.  RB becomes phosphorylated at the beginning of S phase and it is proposed that RBAP-1 carries out a function related to the entry into, or traversal of, S phase by the cells.  Analysis of the DNA-binding properties of RBAP-1 shows that RBAP-1 binds to a DNA sequence that is also bound by cellular extracts that contain an activity know as E2F.  E2F is a transcription factor that is a DNA-binding protein and a cellular target of RB.

Applications/Advantages: The invention can be used to detect the presence of non-wildtype RBAP-1 encoding, or alterations in the expression of wildtype RBAP-1 encoding gene in a tissue sample. An assay can also be designed to identify a ligand that is capable of disrupting the interaction of a viral transforming protein and RB, while not disrupting the interaction of RBAP-1 and RB."," Drug Discovery Tools","http://www.dfci.harvard.edu/res/technology/available.asp?case_number=236&keywords=&category_id=4&category_name=Targets+and+Screens","Ojas Mehta, Phone (617) 632-5807, Fax (617) 632-4012, Email Ojas_Mehta@dfci.harvard.edu","Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"

The discovery of small-molecule modulators of Shh signaling provides an avenue to regulate the activity of a pathway implicated in medulloblastoma, basal cell carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer and developmental disorders. Small-molecule inhibition of extracellular proteins that activate membrane receptors has proven to be extremely challenging. None of the reported synthetic Shh pathway inhibitors are known to target the extracellular protein Shh protein itself. Therefore, scientists at Harvard University use a target-based discovery method to provide a new approach to identify novel modulators of upstream Shh signaling.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Diversity-oriented synthesis and small-molecule microarrays enabled the discovery of robotnikinin, a small molecule that binds the extracellular Sonic hedgehog (Shh) protein and blocks Shh signaling in cell lines, human primary keratinocytes and a synthetic model of human skin in a dose-dependent manner. The IC50 of robotnikinin is approximately 3 uM in the Shh-LIGHT2 cell line, an NIH3T3 line transformed with a Gli-luciferase construct which has been widely used to study Shh signaling. Robotnikinin inhibits the induction of the Shh pathway. The discovery of robotnikinin has provided a powerful small molecule probe of an important signaling pathway involving a step in the pathway not previously accessible to small-molecule modulation. Robotnikinin will be especially valuable as a probe of diseases associated with aberrant Shh pathway activity."," Chemistry  |   Drug Discovery Tools  |   Therapeutics - Drugs","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3216","Rene Castro, (617) 495-3663","Harvard University"

"2952","Licensable Technology","Robust fluorescent probes allow sensitive detection of small molecules","Zhuang, Xiaowei","MARKETS ADDRESSED:The ability to image signal transduction, gene expression and other cellular dynamics depends on fluorescent reporters that can probe local chemical information inside a cell. Due to lack of specific reporters, small signaling molecules, metabolites and drugs cannot be adequately imaged in cells. In addition, most of the currently available fluorescent probes exhibit relatively weak emission and photobleach quickly. Therefore, there is a great need in bioimaging development to create bright and robust fluorescent probes that not only can track the location of molecules of interest but also report their local chemical environment.  Harvard researchers have addressed this need by developing silver nanoparticles that exhibit enormous Raman enhancement effect, on the order of 1015. The invention enables the Raman spectrum of a single molecule near such a particle to be detected, allowing sensitive detection of small molecules, such as metabolites and signaling molecules. The combination of robust fluorescence, giant Raman enhancement and high optical purity allow these novel nanostructures to be used as powerful probes for chemical imaging inside cells.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:The invention is an efficient method to synthesize novel silver nanoparticles with bright fluorescence and a giant Raman enhancement effect. These particles, 2 – 20 nm in diameter, exhibit a highly multi-domain structure with grain sizes down to 1 nm or less. The amount of photons emitted from these particles exceeds that from bright fluorescent dye molecules by four orders of magnitude. Unlike typical colloidal silver nanoparticles, where less than 3% of the nanoparticles exhibit optical properties, the present invention is able to produce more than 95% of the nanoparticles with such strong fluorescence. In addition, unlike current state of the art where strong fluorescence and/or Raman enhancement effects are observed for aggregates of nanoparticles, our technology observes the behavior from single nanoparticles."," Nanotechnology/NEMS  |   Sensing/Imaging","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=2952","Sam Liss, (617) 495-4371","Harvard University"

"4207","Licensable Technology","Safe cranial drilling device","Walsh, Conor James","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Penetrating the skull to measure intracranial pressure is an important intervention for diagnosing raised intracranial pressure following head trauma. Studies show that 1.7 million people suffer from head injury annually in the U.S., totaling $60 billion in costs. 275,000 of those injured annually are hospitalized and 52,000 will eventually die as a result of that injury. The risk of pressure-induced damage can be reduced by penetrating the skull with a small diameter hole and draining excess fluid or placing sensors inside the skull for pressure monitoring. Although frequent monitoring has been correlated with a decrease in mortality rates, only a small percent of patients receive intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring due to the lack of availability of a sufficient number of neurosurgeons.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Offered here is a device that enables non-neurosurgical personnel to safely drill through the skull without the risk of additional brain damage. It consists of a handheld, portable, cranial drilling device that can be used with any diameter drill bit to create holes in the skull without traumatizing underlying brain tissue. The device relies on a dynamic bi-stable mechanism that supports drilling when force is being applied to the drill, but retracts inside a protective sheath when the force is reduced on penetrating the skull. The bi-stable mechanism is activated by centrifugal forces (due to drill rotation) that cause the linkages to change from the drilling position to the collapsed position at the moment of skull penetration. Initial testing on ex-vivo animal structures has verified that the retraction mechanism successfully removes the drill bit before damaging soft tissue beneath the skull. A reload mechanism allows the user to reset the device to the drilling position and create additional holes.The device is designed to access the brain in the emergency room, disaster relief, or in military settings. It is safe, portable, and versatile. Due to its safety features a general surgeon could operate the device, greatly increasing the availability of pressure monitoring for head trauma patients. Additionally, although this device was designed for cranial neurosurgery, the mechanism can also be used to increase safety in other drilling procedures. Our device can drill holes for inserting screws into the vertebrae, pelvis, or puncturing the sternum to access the pericardium while avoiding damage to delicate organs, nerves, or blood vessels."," Medical Devices","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=4207","Sam Liss, (617) 495-4371","Harvard University"

"MCL 2549.0, 20101.0","Licensable Technology","Salvinorin Compounds and Uses Thereof","Cecile Beguin, Ph.D., et al.","Depression is a mental condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Although there are various medications available, many of these have unacceptable side effects. Stressors that cause symptoms of depression increase the activation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) in the nucleus accumbens.  CREB activation results in over-expression of the opioid peptide dynorphin, which is an agonist of the kappa opioid receptors in the brain, and enhances symptoms of depression.  It has been shown in animal models that kappa receptor antagonists produce antidepressant-like effects, possibly by mediating a disinhibition of dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens, thereby facilitating monoamine activity.  The invention features novel chemical compounds based on a naturally occurring molecule that is known to be a high affinity and selective kappa receptor agonist. The chemical structure of the natural compound has been modified in specific ways, to alter its binding properties against the kappa receptor.
     Potential Commercial Uses: The compounds of the invention show high affinity and specificity for the kappa opioid receptor. One derivative in particular was 7-fold more potent (as measured by EC50) than the naturally-occurring starting compound, with efficacy against the receptor of 98% compared to a known kappa agonist. The compounds of the invention can therefore be used in methods of treating depression, or can be the starting point for additional chemistry and drug design to develop antidepressive drugs.

It exploits fundamentally new modes of computation and communication, because it is based on the physical laws of quantum mechanics instead of classical physics. It holds the promise of immense computing power beyond the capabilities of any classical computer, it guarantees absolutely secure communication, and it is directly linked to emerging quantum technologies, such as, for example, quantum-based sensors.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:A team of Harvard, CalTech and Max-Planck-Institute physicists led by Mikhail D. Lukin has proposed an architecture for a scalable, solid-state quantum information processor capable of operating at or near room temperature. The architecture is applicable to realistic conditions, which include disorder and relevant decoherence mechanisms, and includes a hierarchy of control at successive length scales.The approach is based upon recent experimental advances involving Nitrogen-Vacancy color centers in diamond and will provide fundamental insights into the physics of non-equilibrium many-body quantum systems. Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond stand out among other promising qubit implementations in that their electronic spins can be individually polarized, manipulated and optically detected under room temperature conditions. The nuclear spin, which has a long coherence time, serves as the memory qubit, storing quantum information, while the electronic spin will be used to initialize, read out, and mediate coupling between nuclear spins of adjacent registers. While in principle, a perfect array of NV centers would enable scalable quantum information processing, in practice, the finite creation efficiency of such centers along with the requirements for parallelism, necessitate the coupling of registers separated by significantly larger distances. To overcome this challenge, this international team of scientists demonstrate that the coupling between NV centers can be mediated by an optically un-addressable “dark'' spin chain data bus (DSCB). While the implementation and integration of the various proposed elements still require substantial advances in areas ranging from quantum control to materials science, this feasible approach to room temperature quantum information processing can greatly alleviate the stringent requirements associated with cryogenic temperatures, thereby making the realization of a scalable quantum computer significantly more practical. This technology provides a feasible approach to room temperature quantum information processing, which can greatly alleviate the stringent requirements associated with cryogenic temperatures, thereby making the realization of a scalable quantum computer significantly more practical."," Nanotechnology/NEMS  |   Electrical Engineering  |   Sensing/Imaging  |   Electrical Engineering  |   Sensing/Imaging","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=4022","Alan Gordon, (617) 384-5000","Harvard University"

This number is increasing rapidly, fuelled by the rising obesity and diabetes epidemic in industrialized countries such as China. The worldwide market size of metabolic disorders was estimated at US$97.7 billion in 2008. Numerous medications are used routinely to treat patients with metabolic disease, putting them at risk for the occurrence of adverse reactions and drug-drug interactions. Biologics in development include those targeting interleukin 1 beta (Canakinumab, Novartis; XOMA A052, Xoma) and are designed to alleviate inflammatory symptoms of type 2 diabetic patients without addressing the underlying cause of disease. Thus, current options are limited and new therapeutics with minimal side effects that address the primary etiology are needed.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Hotamisligil’s group at the Harvard School of Public Health has identified a secreted factor from adipose tissue (adipokine) that functions systemically to mediate fundamental aspects of metabolic disease. To investigate the function of this factor they developed a neutralizing polyclonal antibody and demonstrated that specific antibody depletion of the adipokine in serum reversed the diabetic phenotype of obese mice.  Antibody administration caused a significant decrease in blood glucose levels within two weeks of treatment and markedly improved glucose disposal curves compared to control animals. Obese mice with decreased serum levels of the factor also exhibited enhanced systemic insulin response as determined by insulin tolerance tests. Conversely, delivery of a recombinant form of the factor into wild type lean mice caused glucose intolerance.The secreted factor is derived from adipocytes with marked increase in dietary and genetic models of obesity.  Evidence indicates that the adipokine is a key component of the adipo-hepatic communication system linking lipolysis to liver glucose production. Hotamisligil’s work suggests that the secreted factor is involved in a novel mechanism of inter-organ communication regulating glucose metabolism and represents a promising target for the treatment of metabolic disease.  Finally, this factor is highly elevated in human obesity and its expression levels correlate very strongly with metabolic complications and cardiovascular disease risk.  Hence, this target presents a safe and effective therapeutic opportunity against type 2 diabetes with cardiovascular benefits."," Therapeutics - Methods","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3362","Vivian Berlin, (617) 496-0474","Harvard University"
"3049","Licensable Technology","Secure sealed-bid auctions - Protecting against fraud in large financial transactions","Rabin, Michael O.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Auctions and electronic marketplaces have been used to facilitate trillions of dollars in trade in the world economy. However, fraud is a big issue that can plague electronic auctions. Different fraud possibilities include an auctioneer deviating from the rules of an auction, an auctioneer “leaking” useful information about bids received during the bidding process, refusal of the auctioneer to accept bids into the auction and refusal by bidders to reveal bids after the bid submission deadline. Most past solutions on the use of cryptography for conducting secure auctions use multiple auctioneers or require shared computation among bidders. Thus the current state-of-the art for secure auctions is still not very scalable, nor is it practical in a business setting. Harvard’s secure online auction technology can be valuable and cost-effective for conducting secure sealed-bid auctions in any commercial setting. In addition to secure online auctions, the technology can be useful for foreign securities exchanges, auctions of financial instruments, sealed-bid quotations for large contracts, in procurement departments, in construction, government, or defense contract bid processes.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:The invention is a practical software protocol for conducting sealed-bid auctions. The auctioneer must accept all bids submitted and follow the published rules of the auction. The bids are maintained secret from the auctioneer and all bidders until the auction closes and no bidder is able to change or repudiate her bid. After the auction, the auctioneer opens the bids but can still announce an outcome and prove it correct without revealing any bid. In addition to a seller, multiple bidders, and an auctioneer, our model uses witnesses to ensure the security of the auction. The witnesses protect both the bidder and the auctioneer against fraud and manipulation. Harvard’s novel technology guarantees bidders that the auction is fair. Our system reduces fraud and encourages honest bidding and competitive behavior among bidders. Insiders are unable to tip off outsiders about values and bidders receive proof that their bid was/was not the lowest. Our technology is scalable, accommodating tens of thousands of bidders in at most a day of computation on a 64-node network. By involving a single auctioneer, our model is also more realistic from a business perspective.The system has been run on commodity hardware."," Software/Algorithms","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3049","Alan Gordon, (617) 384-5000","Harvard University"

"3181","Licensable Technology","Self aligned barrier layers","Gordon, Roy G.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:The ability to quantify interactions between biomolecules is of great interest for scientific and medical research, as well as for drug development. Currently, measurements of the affinity and the kinetics of biomolecular interactions are typically performed in solution, using methods such as calorimetry, stop-flow imaging, or surface plasmon resonance. However, these bulk measurements are limited in many ways, including 1) they report only average behavior, often losing important details associated with metastable states and rare events, and 2) they measure chemistry in the absence of externally applied mechanical stress, which can be dramatically different from the crowded and dynamic environments of living systems. The relatively new field of single-molecule manipulation addresses these problems by directly measuring the behavior of single molecular interactions under force. This enables the study of the mechanical properties of biomolecular complexes and cellular targets, yielding valuable information into both the structure and the function of biological systems at the nanoscale. The field has been largely driven by technology such as the atomic force microscope and optical tweezers. However, these technologies are very expensive and characterization of a single biological interaction is slow and painstaking. Harvard’s high-throughput single-molecule measurement device addresses many of the problems of previous single-molecule methods, while retaining single-molecule sensitivity and control. The instrument can be used for quantifying the affinity and force dependent kinetics of a pair of molecules, as well as exploring the internal states of a single molecule by stretching and relaxing it under force. The single molecule probe finds applications in drug discovery and development, and life science research.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Harvard researchers have developed a radical new method for making massively-parallel, high-throughput single-molecule force measurements. This approach brings single-molecule experimentation to the common scientist by overcoming the laborious measurements, high cost and technical skill that other techniques require. The new instrument is a spinning microscope in which the resulting centrifugal force acts simultaneously on a multitude of single molecules (e.g. proteins, DNA) or single molecular complexes (e.g. receptor-ligand pairs). Each single-molecule system can be observed directly and independently for true single-molecule detection. Another advantage of this technology is that it can provide accurate, calibration-free force control in a wide range of directions and magnitudes, enabling the convenient quantification of a wide variety of force-dependent interactions. This invention provides dramatic advantages in cost, versatility, and especially efficiency, reducing experimental time from days to minutes.Above is a diagram.  A rotary stage spins a miniaturized microscope, imparting a centrifugal force on beads interacting with a cover slip (inset, right). Transmitted light microscope images are sufficient to clearly distinguish between stuck, tethered, and untethered beads (inset, left).

Recombinases themselves (such as cre recombinase) can have toxic effects on cells. The gene for a recombinase, such as the cre-recombinase, is flanked by the recombinase's own target signal sequences. In this manner, when the recombinase protein is produced in sufficient quantity to effect recombination, it deletes the target gene of interest as well as the gene encoding the recombinase itself, thus creating a negative feedback loop for the continued production of the recombinase protein. The end result is that the target genes or sequences of interest are deleted, along with the gene encoding the recombinase.

Applications/Advantages: Cellular toxicity of recombinases. Provides the utility of recombinase technology without introduction of undesirable gene insertions."," Research Reagents","http://www.dfci.harvard.edu/res/technology/available.asp?case_number=655&keywords=&category_id=3&category_name=Research+Reagents","Ruth Emyanitoff, Phone (617) 632-4010, Fax (617) 632-4012, Email Ruth_Emyanitoff@dfci.harvard.edu","Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"

Important applications include the generation of a blood cell counts, cell separation for storage in blood or stem cell banks, detection of pathogens, viruses or circulating tumor cells, separation of tRNA and rRNA, and purification of DNA plasmids or recombinant proteins. Gradient centrifugation requires solutions with known density gradients, which are typically generated by careful layering of different density solutions or by centrifugation of heterogeneous solutions. The invention, AMPS, provides an easy, inexpensive and robust alternative for the generation of such density gradients. An example of an application is the diagnosis of malaria by demonstrating the presence of the less dense infected red blood cells.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:If certain aqueous solutions of polymers are mixed, they do not form homogeneous solutions but separate into discrete layers with known density, so-called AMPS. The number of solutions determines the number of layers formed. Specifically, more than 81 two-phase, 73 three-phase, 38 four-phase, and 8 five-phase systems have been discovered. The density of each phase can be further adjusted by altering the salt concentrations and tuned for the specific application.Because AMPS phase-separate spontaneously, they are very robust to package, which makes them ideal candidates for gradient centrifugation. Compared to non-equilibrium density gradients generated by centrifugation of heterogeneous solutions, AMPS are stable and do not require calibration procedures or special centrifuges. Compared to centrifugation systems that use a “frit” or polyester gel to separate two phases, AMPS can readily generate multi-layer systems to separate more than just two classes of cells, particles or molecules. The method is ideal for in-field use, Doctor’s offices and factory floor or in the developing world, as it requires no power, has no moving parts and provides results readily discernable by the naked eye."," Materials Diagnostics  |   Instrumentation  |   Materials Diagnostics  |   Instrumentation","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3865","Mick Sawka, (617) 496-3830","Harvard University"
"CCMC   2284","Licensable Technology","Sepiapterin reductase inhibitors for the treatment of pain","Blagg, Julian","Sepiapterin reductase (SPR) is part of the tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) de novo synthesis cascade.  Prior to joining Boston Children's, Drs. Clifford Woolf, Michael Costigan and Alban Latremoliere, using expression arrays had identified three of the enzymes that are crucial to the control of intracellular levels of BH4 as highly regulated within injured sensory neurons, including SPR.  Up-regulation of these enzymes in these injured neurons causes a massive excess of BH4. This was validated in humans by identification of gene polymorphisms that reduce BH4 levels and showing that these are associated with a reduced risk of chronic pain.BH4 is an essential cofactor for the enzymes that produce serotonin, dopamine, epinephrine, nor-epinephrine and nitric oxide. Altering BH4 levels in injured sensory neurons consequently has profound effects on cellular physiology. Inhibiting SPR will reduce pathological BH4 levels in sensory neurons while retaining basal BH4 levels in other cells and therefore acts as an analgesic without adverse side effects.  To achieve this goal, several compound classes of small molecule inhibitors of SPR were identified and are described and claimed in a patent application that is now assigned to Children's. Dr. Woolf's lab at Boston Children's is currently testing one series of compounds, including ACS 8099, in proof of concept in vivo studies for treatment of chronic pain."," Therapeutics - Drugs  |   Drug Discovery Tools","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=2284","Caron, Connie, connie.caron@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"

"334","Licensable Technology","Signal Transduction via CD28","Rudd, C","The T-cell antigen CD28 provides a costimulatory signal for T-cell activation. This technology is based upon the finding that CD28 binds the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), and that PI 3-kinase is a part of the activation cascade. This invention provides methods for modulating T cell activation by exploiting this pathway. One may reduce T-cell activation by interfering with the CD28-PI 3-kinase interaction. For example, if CD28 lacks a specified portion of its cytoplasmic tail, it binds PI 3-kinase to a lesser degree and T cell activation is subsequently decreased. Conversely, to enhance T cell activation, T cell surface proteins1 may be engineered to contain multiple PI 3-kinase binding domains in their cytoplasmic tails and introduced into T cells. Last, this technology provides methods for screening drug candidates that modulate the interaction of CD28 and PI 3-kinase.

Applications/Advantages: Since blocking the association of PI 3-kinase with CD28 can reduce T cell activation, this method may be useful in downregulating the immune response in patients with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, type 1 diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis. Suppression of the T cell-mediated immune response may also be useful to prevent rejection of a transplanted organ or cells with allograft or xenograft recipients. In contrast, one may activate T cells using the methods of the invention to boost the immune response against tumor cells following surgery or in conjunction with other cancer therapies. Similarly, one may use this technology to activate the T cells of immunocompromised or immunosuppressed patients."," Research Reagents","http://www.dfci.harvard.edu/res/technology/available.asp?case_number=334&keywords=&category_id=3&category_name=Research+Reagents","Nancy Grodin, Phone (617) 632-5516, Fax (617) 632-4012, Email Nancy_Grodin@dfci.harvard.edu","Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"

They have low dark noise, high response speeds and relatively low cost. The conventional silicon photodiode works very well in the 700-900nm wavelength region with high efficiency and response times. However, because of the intrinsic limitations of the material, silicon produces a huge drop in sensitivity above 1000nm. Additionally, alternatives to silicon-based photo diodes such as InGaAs are expensive and difficult to use.   A team of Harvard physicists led by Michael J.

The material is created by employing an ion-implantation technique using a nanosecond laser to melt the basis of single silicon crystal. Sulfur and selenium are then ion-implanted into silicon. The implanted layer is then damaged and becomes amorphous. After that, a 1 to 50ns laser pulse is employed to melt the material to a depth slightly greater than the thickness of the amorphous layer. The melted material then solidifies as a single crystal of quality comparable to a virgin silicon wafer. Annealing is also required for some samples.

"4261","Licensable Technology","Simple, cost-effective, and tunable density-based separation, purification, and analysis of biological samples","Whitesides, George M.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Multi-phase systems typically consist of immiscible, aqueous solutions of polymers or surfactants. When such immiscible liquids are mixed, they spontaneously phase-separate into discrete phases/layers, ordered according to density. Complex samples introduced into this multi-phase system separate into distinct components and these components migrate to different layers characteristic of their densities. This density-based separation allows for visual analysis of individual component properties. The samples migrate through the multi-phase system based on gravity or centrifugation.   This method can be used to purify (and extract) or visually check (with the naked eye) for the presence of impurities (pathogens, pests, heavy metals, pesticides) in various samples, such as food, drugs, or plants. This technique can also be used to analyze biological samples, such as cells, for diseases or infections.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Due to the large variety of polymers, surfactants, and additives than can be mixed to create multi-phase systems, there is a vast number of possible applications for this technique. The phase components can be selected to be biologically compatible to allow for the separation and analysis (or study) of living organisms or cells without affecting viability. Biological samples (saliva, blood) can be separated from non-biological samples (rock, debris) in a forensic science context. This technique is sensitive enough to detect differences in densities as low as 0.001 g/cm3. Because this multi-phase separation is spontaneous and stable, this technique does not require any calibration, and it is possible to use these systems without centrifugation for certain applications. Even when centrifugation is required, a simple egg-beater centrifuge (i.e. portable, hand-operated) can be used.The use of aqueous polymers that exhibit limited interaction to create multi-phase systems provides additional advantages: they are easy to prepare, they are stable and amenable to long term storage, and they are versatile (with easily altered composition and density). The multi-phase system can also be enclosed in many different containers (vials, tubes, plates) and can even be deposited on paper, cloth, or string. As an example, it was demonstrated that an egg-beater centrifuge can be combined with an aqueous polymer multi-phase system to create a low-cost, point-of-care test for diagnosing malaria in the field with only 10 µL of blood, and without any sample preparation or microscopy.Even when the analytes of interest do not differ in density from other objects or impurities in the sample, these analytes can be tagged (vie binding or other interactions) to a molecule or object that changes its density, allowing for its separation. This technique can be used to identify infections and diseases. For example, cancer cells or cells infected with certain viruses can be selectively tagged (due to the cell’s expression of specific proteins) and subsequently separated. By combining multi-phase systems with magnetic levitation, a tunable approach to the separation and analysis of materials emerges. By adding paramagnetic solutes and applying a magnetic field to the multi-phase system, one can create tunable density gradients in the density steps/layers of the phase-separated system without the need for centrifugation. Thus, this system allows for the analysis of a wider density range than is possible with the multi-phase system or with magnetic levitation alone, further expanding the field of possible applications of this density-based separation technique.The use of multi-phase polymer systems with magnetic levitation provides a tunable, cost-effective, portable, and easy-to-use density-based analysis and purification technique for biological samples."," Instrumentation","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=4261","Mick Sawka, (617) 496-3830","Harvard University"

"3439","Licensable Technology","Small molecule activators of HRI kinase: A new class of anti-cancer therapeutics and biomarker for cancer patient selection","Aktas, Huseyin","MARKETS ADDRESSED:New class of anti-cancer therapeutics: Recent studies have shown that HRI is expressed in tissues other than hematopoietic cells. For the first time, Harvard researchers have demonstrated that activation of this kinase interferes with proliferation of cancer cells in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. This suggests that this class of compounds might become a starting point for new anti-cancer therapeutics. At the same time, the compounds will be used in research laboratories to better understand the role of translation initiation cellular development, differentiation, and proliferation.Method for cancer patient selection: HRI can also be used as a biomarker to select cancer patients for treatment with diarylurea and diarylthiourea compounds.  The Aktas lab has developed an assay to determine the expression level of HRI in any given cancer cell. Patients with cancer cells that have a higher level of HRI expression will respond more effectively to treatment of cancer with diarylurea and diarylthiourea compounds.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Background: Translation initiation plays a critical role cellular homeostasis, proliferation and differentiation. A key regulatory step in the translation initiation cascade is the assembly of a ternary complex formed by the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2), GTP and the initiator methionine tRNA (Met-tRNAi). This molecular machinery is highly conserved and many effectors can modulate translation initiation in a variety of species – from unicellular parasites to higher mammals. eIF2a and ER Stress: The endoplasmic reticulum is the major signal transducing organelle that sense and responds to changes in homeostasis.  Conditions that interfere with ER function, collectively called ER stress, is induced by accumulation of unfolded protein aggregates or increased protein traffic.  Accumulation of unfolded protein aggregates triggers eIF2 phosphorylation attenuates general protein synthesis and induces cell death in both a caspase-dependent and a caspase-independent manner.  Recent research indicates cytoprotection in cancers through a modulated ER stress pathway.  By inducing eIF2a phosphorylation via HRI kinase activation (described further below), anti-proliferative phenotypes in vitro have been shown in cancer cell lines.Small molecule screen for ternary complex effectors:  Researchers in Aktas laboratory have executed a high-throughput screen for small molecule modulators of ternary complex abundance. For this, they took advantage of the paradoxical increase in the translation of the activating transcription factor-4 (ATF-4) upon depletion of the ternary complex. Murine cells were transfected with dual luciferase plasmid coding for ATF-4-reporter or control-reporter.

Corresponding compounds were included into the follow-up assays.A new class ternary complex inhibitors: Analysis of the screening data revealed a high prevalence of a certain class of compounds. Subsequent mechanistic studies indicate the mechanism of action and possible therapeutic use of the compounds:•     The mechanism of action: Researchers have determined that the small molecules in this class activate Heme Regulated Inhibitor (HRI) kinase, since RNAi knock-down of the enzyme interfered with activities of the hits. The kinase is known to phosphorylate eIF2a subunit of the initiation factor, which, in turn, inactivates the whole ternary complex. They also demonstrated direct interaction of compounds with HRI.  •     Compounds are low-toxic: Three-week treatment of mice with the compounds did not result in any outward signs of toxicity, or abnormal blood parameters, or histological appearance of any organs.•     N,N'-diarylureas inhibit cancer cell proliferation in vitro growth of mammary tumors in vivo. Researchers determined that hit compounds inhibit proliferation of cancer cells in vitro and that this dependent on HRI-dependent phosphorylation of eIF2a. They further demonstrated that anti-proliferative activity of hit compounds correlates with the expression of HRI. Finally they determined that hit compounds inhibit growth of mammary tumors in mouse model of human breast cancer. Thinhibition of tumor growth was associated with phosphorylation of eIF2a in the tumors."," Therapeutics - Drugs","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3439","Grant Zimmermann, (617) 495-3067","Harvard University"
"4828","Licensable Technology","Small molecule inhibition of Dengue Virus","Yang, Priscilla","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Dengue virus (DV) is the cause of dengue fever. An estimated 2.5 billion people live in areas at risk for epidemic transmission. Fatality rates associated with severe dengue fever are as high as 20%. DV is recognized as a major public health concern, and extensive outbreaks of DV infection have occurred in Puerto Rico and Florida in recent years. Spread of DV in the continental U.S. is probable because the mosquito vector responsible for transmission of DV is now endemic throughout the southeastern U.S. In addition, the Dept. of Defense has ranked severe dengue fever as number three in the top 40 disease threats to deployed military forces. There is no specific therapeutic to combat DV infection nor is there a vaccine that protects against all four DV serotypes. ChimeriVax, a recombinant, live tetravalent DV vaccine that is currently the most advanced candidate, exhibited only 30% efficacy and did not appear to protect against DV2 infection in a Phase IIb clinical trial, highlighting the need for alternative approaches to combat DV infection. Currently, the only treatment for severe dengue fever is supportive care, primarily maintenance of the patient's circulating fluid volume. Alternative strategies to prevent and control DV infection are urgently needed. The strong correlation between viral load and disease severity suggests that antivirals that inhibit DV and reduce viral burden might reduce the severity of DV-associated disease.The majority of Dengue antiviral discovery efforts are in the stages of identifying and testing candidate compounds. Over the past decade, Novartis has pursued anti-DV drug discovery via the Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases (NITD). To our knowledge, their efforts have focused on viral targets such as the DV NS5 RNA polymerase and the NS3 protease. Several NS5 inhibitors (NITD008, -449, and -203) have been abandoned due to unfavorable toxicity; Roche independently discovered and abandoned the compound corresponding to NITD008. United Therapeutics Corporation and Enantigen Therapeutics are both pursuing imino sugar inhibitors of host glucosidases as anti-DV agentsThis technology has potential use an antiviral therapy:•     As a small molecule inhibitor of Dengue Virus•     As a broad spectrum inhibitor for plus and minus strand RNA virusesINNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:In a screen of bioactive lipids and small molecule modulators of lipid metabolism, The Yang lab made discovered a synthetic molecule that is potently antiviral. 1.

Preliminary data indicate that this molecule inhibits steady-state DV RNA replication and also has significant inhibitory activity against poliovirus, rotavirus, Junin virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus, suggesting that it may have potential as a broad-spectrum inhibitor of RNA viruses.Though this molecule’s antineoplastic activities have been associated with the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased ceramides, and the induction of autophagy, the target and biochemical mechanism of action mediating its biological activities have yet to be unequivocally elucidated.

"22099","Licensable Technology","Small Molecule Inhibitor of Primordial Germ Cell (PGC) maintenance","Peterson, Randall T.; Schlueter, Peter","Technology:  Dr Peterson and Dr. Schlueter of MGH have identified a compound, Primordazine, which can specifically inhibit ovaum and sperm development in zebrafish.  Primordazine acts on the primordial germ cells (PGCs) that give rise to sperm and eggs in the gonad and cause fish to become essentially sterile.  Other than being sterile, Primordazine-treated zebrafish develop into a healthy, normal adult fish. 
 
  As the global demand for farm-raised fish is growing, the need to reduce fish farming costs is apparent. As fish expedn an enormous amount of energy on gonad development, fish with diminished gonadal celles or ablated PGCs arelikely to grow much faster. Primordazine-treated fish grow faster than fertile fish, while consuming less fish feed overall.  This translates into savings on fish feed, the major cost in fish farming and reduces time to market.  

Genetically modified fish have been created to produce sterile fish in an attempt to save costs, which has raised public concern on the safety of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).  Primordazine application does not involve genetic manipulation and the resulting sterile fish, even if accidentally introduced into neaby waters, will not be able to breed with the wild population.
 
Applications:  
?	Fish growth acceleration. Sterilization of commercial fish in aquatic culture to accelerate the growth of fish, translating to cost savings on fish feed and labor.
?	Containment of transgenic fish- can be used in combination with wild type or fertile transgenic fish that are raised in outdoor facilities or sea cages, in order to minimize the introduction of those fish into the wild-type population.

Advantages:  
?	Convenience: The technology uses a chemical to treat fish embryos en masse, as opposed to time-consuming development and construction of transgenic sterile fish
?	Specificity: The technology only affects the germ cells and not the somatic tissues of the fish
?	Compatibility: The technology is expected to be compatible for use with both wild type and transgenic fish
?	Non-GMO: The technology bypasses genetic manipulation to produce sterile fish

There are strong structural and functional similarities among HIV, influenza, Ebola, Lassa fever, respiratory syncytial virus and possibly dengue and hepatitis C virus glycoproteins.  Identification of host proteins of interest: The long standing interest of this laboratory is to identify host proteins that activate virus glycoproteins.   Recently, we have focused on the Ebola virus (EboV), which causes outbreaks of rapidly fatal hemorrhagic fever for which there is no therapy.  We determined that cleavage of the GP1 subunit of the EboV glycoprotein by host endosomal cysteine proteases is the first step in a two-step mechanism and is functionally analogous to the role of CD4 binding to gp120 in HIV infection. Small molecule inhibitors of Ebola: In newly completed work, we screened a small molecule library provided by NSRB and identified six novel compounds that inhibit the second, post-protease, step in EboV infection.  Four of these compounds specifically inhibit EboV and not Lassa fever or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) infection.  Remarkably, we find that 3.3, a derivative of the EboV inhibitor 3.0, is a more potent inhibitor of the Lassa fever virus and that an additional compound (7.0) blocks EboV and Lassa fever virus infection equally well.  These findings suggest that closely related host factors trigger infection by Ebola and Lassa fever viruses, and also that the inhibitors we have identified may be lead compounds for development of new anti-viral drugs."," Therapeutics - Drugs","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3755","Michal Preminger, (617) 432-0920","Harvard University"
"1653","Licensable Technology","Small molecule inhibitors of the Bcl-XL/Bak interaction activate the cell death pathway","Yuan, Junying","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Therapeutics: This invention addresses the need for selective and efficient inhibitors of BH3 domain-mediated heterodimerization of Bcl-2 family proteins. Treatment with small molecule BH3 inhibitors disrupts its interaction with Bax and Bak and enables them to trigger the cell death pathway. The exciting prospects of clinical manipulation of the Bcl-XL/Bak interaction may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancers and autoimmune diseases:•  Cancer therapy: Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins are over-expressed in a number of tumors, including hematological cancers (leukemias), and several types of solid cancer, including prostate, breast and lung cancers.  In addition, they are frequently associated with resistance to conventional chemo- and radiotherapy. The BH3 inhibitors discovered in the Yuan laboratory can be used alone or in combination with already existing therapeutic agents.•  Rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases: Recent reports indicate that BH3-only members of the Bcl-2 family can be immunomodulators and play a role in the development of rheumatoid arthritis. BH3 inhibitors can potentially become therapeutics against this chronic and widespread disease. Screen to identify new BH3 inhibitors: The high-throughput screening method developed by the inventors is simple, cheap and efficient. Secondary screening validated the activity and specificity of the small molecule screen hits. This screening method could be used to screen a larger library and discover new small molecule BH3 inhibitors.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:The removal of unneeded or damaged cells by apoptosis is essential for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and the prevention of cancer.  Apoptosis also plays a critical role in cancer therapy, as many cytotoxic agents used in chemotherapy act by promoting apoptotic cell death.  Indeed, insensitivity of tumor cells to radiation or chemotherapy can often be attributed to defects in apoptotic signaling pathways.  Therefore, compounds that can stimulate apoptosis might become powerful new anticancer therapeutics.Attractive therapeutic target:  Members of the Bcl-2 protein family are central regulators of apoptosis, making disrupting the interaction between Bcl-2 and its pro-apoptotic binding partners an attractive therapeutic target.  There are two pan Bcl-2 small molecule inhibitors in clinical phase II trials (Ascenta Therapeutics; Gemin X), and several in pre-clinical stage development (Abbott) for both hematological and solid tumors.Screen for small molecule activators of apoptosis:  Bax and Bak, two proapoptotic members of the family permeablize the outer mitochondrial membrane and trigger the apoptosis cascade. Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and other anti-apoptotic proteins bind to the BH3 domain of Bax and Bak, reducing their activity and preventing apoptosis. Dr. Yuan’s laboratory developed an in vitro screen to discover small molecules that disrupt binding of Bcl-XL to Bak’s BH3 domain. In the screen, a fluorescently tagged Bak-derived peptide is bound to the recombinant Bcl-XL. Screen hits (termed BH3 inhibitors) displaced this peptide and caused a change in fluorescence.BH3 inhibitors (BH3Is) block Bcl-XL/Bak interaction and induce cell death:  The secondary screening efforts summarized below validated the cellular target and physiological effects of the screen hits.  Taken together these findings imply that discovered BH3 inhibitors are a new class of highly selective small molecules that can induce apoptosis in cancerous cells.•  BH3 inhibitors are selective: In vitro binding assays demonstrated that the small molecule screen hits specifically disrupted interactions between the BH3 domain and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, and did not disrupt non-specific protein-protein interactions.•  BH3 inhibitors increase cell death in cancer-like cells: An increased level of apoptosis was observed in cultured human cells upon treatment with BH3Is. Remarkably, cells pre-treated with a caspase inhibitor, which lead to decreased apoptosis (a hallmark of cancer cells), were also susceptible to the BH3Is.•  BH3 inhibitors disrupt Bax/Bcl-XL interaction in vivo: Fluorescently tagged proteins, Bax-YFP and Bcl-XL-CFP were co-expressed and their in vivo interaction was confirmed using FRET, an optical microscopy technique that measures protein-protein binding. Upon addition of the BH3Is, the FRET signal diminished indicating that Bax, the proapoptotic protein, was not bound to Bcl- XL and could trigger cell death."," Therapeutics - Drugs","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=1653","Michal Preminger, (617) 432-0920","Harvard University"

For the first time, Harvard researchers have demonstrated that activation of this kinase interferes with proliferation of cancer cells in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. This suggests that this class of compounds might become a starting point for new anti-cancer therapeutics. At the same time, the compounds will be used in research laboratories to better understand the role of translation initiation cellular development, differentiation, and proliferation.Method for cancer patient selection: HRI can also be used as a biomarker to select cancer patients for treatment with diarylurea and diarylthiourea compounds.  The Aktas lab has developed an assay to determine the expression level of HRI in any given cancer cell. Patients with cancer cells that have a higher level of HRI expression will respond more effectively to treatment of cancer with diarylurea and diarylthiourea compounds.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Background: Translation initiation plays a critical role cellular homeostasis, proliferation and differentiation. A key regulatory step in the translation initiation cascade is the assembly of a ternary complex formed by the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2), GTP and the initiator methionine tRNA (Met-tRNAi). This molecular machinery is highly conserved and many effectors can modulate translation initiation in a variety of species – from unicellular parasites to higher mammals. eIF2a and ER Stress: The endoplasmic reticulum is the major signal transducing organelle that sense and responds to changes in homeostasis.  Conditions that interfere with ER function, collectively called ER stress, is induced by accumulation of unfolded protein aggregates or increased protein traffic.  Accumulation of unfolded protein aggregates triggers eIF2 phosphorylation attenuates general protein synthesis and induces cell death in both a caspase-dependent and a caspase-independent manner.  Recent research indicates cytoprotection in cancers through a modulated ER stress pathway.  By inducing eIF2a phosphorylation via HRI kinase activation (described further below), anti-proliferative phenotypes in vitro have been shown in cancer cell lines.Small molecule screen for ternary complex effectors:  Researchers in Aktas laboratory have executed a high-throughput screen for small molecule modulators of ternary complex abundance. For this, they took advantage of the paradoxical increase in the translation of the activating transcription factor-4 (ATF-4) upon depletion of the ternary complex. Murine cells were transfected with dual luciferase plasmid coding for ATF-4-reporter or control-reporter.  Increase in the ATF-4 reporter to control reporter ratio signified increase in ATF-4 translation and ternary complex depletion.

In ongoing unpublished studies the researchers have identified derivatives with single-digit nanomolar IC50 values and other therapeutically important properties. Given the central role of protein kinases in cellular signal transduction cascades, pharmaceutical companies are intensively pursuing the discovery and development of targeted cancer therapeutic agents that act by selective kinase inhibition. As of 2011 the FDA has approved at least nine small-molecule kinase inhibitors targeting a range of cancers (e.g. imatinib/Gleevec), and dozens more are in development. However, the high sequence conservation around the ATP-binding pocket across the hundreds of kinases in the human kinome suggests that the development of an arsenal of specific kinase inhibitors will require molecules that interact outside the ATP-binding pocket. An additional challenge is the development of agents capable of inhibiting kinases that harbor mutations observed in many drug-resistant cancers.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Macrocyclic compounds have unique properties that allow them to cover regions of chemical space not addressed by other small-molecule structural classes. By performing an in vitro selection screen of a broad untargeted DNA-encoded library of 13,824 synthetic small-molecule macrocycles against 36 biomedically relevant protein targets, including 9 kinases (Akt4, AMPK ERBB4, Mk2, p38a, MKK6, Pim1, Src, VEGFR2) researchers in the laboratory of David Liu have discovered a novel class of highly selective and potent Src kinase inhibitors. Best initial hits included molecules with Src IC50 values of 960nM (cis-All-B1-C5-D7) and 680nM (trans-A10-B1-C5-D6), with trans-A10-B1-C5-D6 having no significant off-target inhibition when tested against a panel of 44 human kinases that included all nine members of the Src kinase family. This specificity is especially intriguing since both of these macrocycles were shown to be ATP-competitive inhibitors.Chemical structure of screening library and best initial Src inhibitor hits Selectivity of macrocycles cis-A11-B1-C5-D7 and trans-A10-B1-C5-D6 among Src-related kinases, including all nine Src-family kinasesFuture Directions This research has revealed promising compounds for the further development of selective and potent molecules that can modulate the function of cellular kinases.

Self-splicing protein elements known as inteins, which are able to catalyze their excision out of a single polypeptide and leave behind precisely ligated flanking sequences (exteins), are attractive starting points for the creation of such switches because their insertion into a protein blocks the target protein’s function until splicing occurs, and because they are able to rapidly splice out of a wide variety of extein contexts. Natural inteins, however, are not known to be regulated by small molecules.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Researchers in the laboratory of Professor David Liu have used directed evolution techniques to evolve an intein-based molecular switch that transduces binding of a small molecule into the activation of an arbitrary protein of interest. To create the switch, the researchers replaced the dispensable homing endonuclease domain of the RecA intein with the ligand-binding domain of the human estrogen receptor (ER) to yield an (N)-interin-ER-intein(C) fusion. This chimeric intein was then fused into a number of protein (extein) contexts to facilitate rounds of positive (negative) selection for ligand-dependent splicing in the presence (absence) of the synthetic small molecule 4-hydroxytamoxifen. The switch was shown to be effective in multiple protein contexts in both yeast and mammalian cells. The researchers recently reported second-generation evolved inteins that exhibit substantially improved splicing yields and kinetics over previously reported first generation inteins.These new ligand-dependent inteins represent effective and broadly applicable tools for the small-molecule-triggered, posttranslational modulation of protein activities in living systems including mammalian cells, and for the in vivo activation of intein-fused therapeutic proteins.

One way to build out this knowledge base is to measure the energy released or absorbed by biomolecular chemical reactions and physical changes. Biocalorimetry measures that energy. With those measurements,    researchers can characterize the structure, activity, and function of biomolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. They then have a solid foundation for designing and optimizing drugs that could treat or prevent disease through biomolecular intervention. Conventional calorimetry methods are not widely used because they require large amounts of reactants, generate low sample throughput, require long experiment run times, need sequential runs to confirm results, cannot measure some sensitive chemical reactions, and are expensive. Drs. Kowalski and Larson developed a biocalorimeter that overcomes these limitations. It assesses the chemical interactions more accurately, faster, and more efficiently than conventional devices. This chip-scale biocalorimeter could help reduce drug development costs and risks by providing more accurate data with less complex experimentation. The device could be used in a variety of applications including, nanoscale to microscale calorimetrics for pharmaceutical and biotechnology products, combustion sensing, explosive detection, and biotoxin monitoring.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Drs. Kolawski and Larson developed their new biocalorimetry device using surface, plasmon-enhanced radiation. Radiation is directed at a thin, electrically conductive film that has one or more small apertures. The radiation excites one film surface, and the energy associated with that reaction is  coupled to the  opposite film surface, through the small apertures.  A temperature-sensitive fluid, or solid, dielectric material next to the film is changed by the radiation as it comes through the apertures. The temperature changes in the dielectric material, including very minute changes, can then be measured. With this simpler, less expensive system, biomolecular chemical reactions can be more accurately measured than with current calorimeters."," ","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=2639","Alan Gordon, (617) 384-5000","Harvard University"

The inventors have designed, synthesized, and tested a near-infrared (NIR) probe that binds to amyloid beta (A-Beta) plaques. The probe has been used for early detection of A-Beta plaques in an animal model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 

This molecule meets all the requirements of an ideal NIR probe for early AD detection: 
1) good specificity to A-Beta plaques; 2) reasonable lipophilicity; 3) low molecular weight (< 600 dalton); 4) emission wavelength >650nm and a large stokes shift; 5) high affinity binding constant 6) 40% quantum yield upon binding to aggregates; 7) low affinity binding with BSA; 8) good stability in blood; 9) good synthetic accessibility; 10) the probe exhibits 70x increase in fluorescence intensity and a significant change in fluorescence properties upon binding to A-Beta plaques. If desired, a corresponding PET probe or MR probe can be made as well. 

Application:	  	

- Tools for early detection of AD
- Monitoring the progress of AD 
- Drug discovery screening 
- Potential targeting vehicle for therapeutics to treat AD
 
Advantages: 

Memory and behavior tests, which are often used for clinical diagnosis of Alzheimers disease, are subjective by definition. Such tests are also not suitable for early detection at the onset of the disease because patients do not exhibit noticeable symptoms at the early stages of AD. Therefore, the early detection of AD still presents a challenge. NIR Imaging is a very attractive tool for early AD detection because of its acceptable depth penetration, non-invasive operation, and inexpensive instrumentation.
 	
The probe is easy to synthesize through simple chemistry.  It also has good specificity for A-Beta plaques. The probe can be used with NIR imaging, which is low cost and non-invasive.

"4231","Licensable Technology","Soft artifical skin with multi-modal sensing capabilities","Wood, Robert J.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:This material is the only approach for highly deformable sensing.  High potential applications include medical devices, robotic sensing, gaming, biomedical rehabilitation, sports active wear and military gear.  Hyperelastic strain sensors can also be applied in several areas such as haptics, humanoid robotics, and medical robotics. These sensors, due to their high mechanical compliance and their amenability to complex form factors (shapes), can be used for tactile sensing on humanoid robots and medical devices with complex morphologies (surfaces with high curvature or roughness). This technology has a much higher strain capacity that conventional sensor technologies (e.g. capacitive sensors), is inexpensive to manufacture, and can be made biocompatible.In addition to applications in existing markets, this invention also has applications in several nascent markets including flexible and wearable computing (keypads, remote device controls, wearable gaming devices), sports gear and clinical-grade orthotics (“smart” pressure and strain sensing orthopedic braces or pads), tactile and motion sensors for robotics and advanced human computer interfaces (palpation for medical robots, motion capture systems), and humanoid robotics and prostheses (tactile sensation and contact localization for robotic hands, artificial skin).INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Soft artificial skin is a highly deformable, conformal material that senses pressure and strain.  Represents a new class of materials embedding function (sensing, actuation, communication, etc) in soft materials.  The hyperelastic sensor fabrication process uses novel soft lithography to create flexible sensors on an unprecedented scale (sub-millimeter features), allowing much higher spatial resolution than available in current products. This mold-based manufacturing process for these sensors is also scalable and allows for multilayered sensor packages that increase sensitivity and accommodate multiple sensing modes, including axial strain, force, and pressure. Hyperelastic sensors offer a strain capacity of up to 900%, much high than conventional sensor technologies (e.g. capacitive sensors, fiber optic strain sensors), is inexpensive to manufacture, can be made biocompatible, and conformable to complex, deformable surfaces (e.g. surface of human arm, finger, etc.)."," Plastics and Polymers Engineering  |   Mechanical Engineering  |   Robotics/Automation  |   Mechanical Engineering  |   Robotics/Automation","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=4231","Sam Liss, (617) 495-4371","Harvard University"

"T001392","Licensable Technology","Soft Robotics","Barry Trimmer","Tufts University Categories:engineeringenvironmental:monitoringmaterialsAdditional Keywords:Biocompatible/Biopolymer, Soft-bodied robotInvention SummaryTechnology:Currently, there are very few examples of predominantly soft material robots. While attempts have been made to produce rudimentary crawling devices using electroactive polymers and shape memory alloy (SMA)- actuated bodies, these designs have failed to produce a completely-soft bodied robot and have shown only limited flexibility and control. Researchers at Tufts University have developed a softbodied robot prototype (SoftBot), which does not contain rigid components, and which is based on the segmented, hydrostatic body form of the caterpillar Manduca Sexta. Manduca is considered a model organism for this type of research because of its use of fluid and tissue pressure, as opposed to a hard skeleton, to stiffen its body for its muscles to cause movement.The generation of such a robot is potentially of great use in a number of fields, as it will mimic some of the performance capabilities of Manduca, including the following promised novel features:- Astounding scalability (potentially over 10,000 fold mass)- Proficient climbing of textured and branched structures- Remarkable flexibility and shape-shifting ability- Silent movement- Inexpensive manufacturing- Low power consumption- Robustness to damage- Morphing payloads including micro-SoftBots, which will access targets on even smaller scales- An integrated neuromechanical control systemAdditionally, the exploitation of all degradable biopolymer systems during subsequent production of SoftBot will allow utility of the robots in a broad range of environmental applications, as well as medical sensors, without requiring retrieval subsequent to completion of the tasks.Professor Barry Trimmer and colleagues at Tufts University have developed a prototyped design that will lead to a completely soft, biodegradable, climbing, and morphing robot that can be implemented over mass scales of at least three orders of magnitude. Critical to the process are the development of an integrated neuromechanical control system using smart materials to distribute the computational load, a simple and rapid platform construction process accommodating diverse initial shapes and a wide variety of soft materials, and the design and synthesis of new functionalized biopolymers to be used as structural, sensing, and moving components of SoftBot.Market Opportunity:Immediately Addressable Markets: ToysAs SoftBot will be manufactured inexpensively, a short-term milestone for its continuing development is in the childhood toy market. Either tethered to a power source or operating autonomously, SoftBot will change the idea of a robotic pet from one with metal and hinges to one with a completely soft and animal-like body.Longer-term Markets: Covert Intelligence GatheringSoftBot has a number of potential applications in intelligence gathering, covert operating, and silent and/or passive traveling to dangerous or unsecured locations. Hair-like force sensors on the ""skin"" of SoftBot will deliver real-time information on the direction and magnitude of surface shear and normal forces, a wireless power and data transmission processes will signal to a central controller during surveillance, and silent movement and passive gripping to ropes, wires, and other vertical structures, as well as the ability to morph and access complex or confined spaces, will enable SoftBot to gather information from areas unsafe for or inaccessibly by humans.Biodegradable Medical ApplicationsSoftBot also has potential in in vivo applications in diagnostic and surgical biomedical devices and sensors, as SoftBot will be designed of fully biodegradable proteins, such that retrieval following the completion of a medical task will not be necessary. Additionally, the employment of conformable payloads and the locomotive ability of SoftBot in a number of shape-shifted forms allows for a wide variety of both in vitro and in vivo uses.Space and Satellite ApplicationsAs SoftBot will have the ability to travel in environments unsafe for humans, it has potential in space applications, where it would be capable of surveying and fixing mechanical structural flaws on the outside of a spaceship or satellite. As SoftBot is softbodied and collapsible to an uninflated state, it is ideal for these tasks because it is lightweight, easy to pack, and will not damage the ship’s hardware.Commercialization:To date, development of the Tufts SoftBot technology has been and continues to be funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Given the source of research funding, initial focus has been centered on ensuring the scalability and flexibility of the design in order to meet key requirements for intended Department of Defense (DoD) covert intelligence applications.Tufts University seeks to enter into licensing relationships with industry or partner with an entrepreneurial individual or team to explore the potential to develop a startup company based on this and additional highly complementary technologies from the university."," Environment  |   Mechanical Engineering  |   Materials","http://www.tufts.biz/cgi-bin/tech_search.cgi?r=1&case=T001392","Martin Son617-636-3605martin.son@tufts.edu","Tufts University"

A core symptom in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is anhedonia, the inability to enjoy pleasurable activities and experiences. Anhedonia is considered one of the most promising MDD endophenotypes to investigate neurobiological correlates of MDD. Recent evidence suggests that anhedonia may result from abnormal functioning of the Brain Reward System, the neurobiological system that mediates pleasure and motivation, in depressed patients. Anhedonia is not only critical for identifying subjects at risk for psychopathology, but has also been found to predict treatment outcome and relapse rate for several mental disorders. The incidence of mental illness in the United States affects about 22.1 percent of adults annually or 44.3 million people (NIMH). Approximately 1 in 4 (22.10%) or 60.1 million people in the US are afflicted with at least one type of mental illness.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:The invention is a software that objectively and reliably assesses anhedonia. This assessment tool involves a computerized task with a differential reinforcement schedule that utilizes a reward (such as money) to provide an objective, laboratory-based measure of hedonic capacity.

For the initial discovery of biomarkers, patients with fever evaluated for Kawasaki disease were studied using exhaustive protein capture and high-accuracy mass spectrometry.  Using this approach >2000 unique proteins were identified, of which 190 were uniquely measured in patients with active Kawasaki disease.  Urine samples were collected from all subjects at the time of their diagnostic work-up and following successful treatment. ||

"4173","Licensable Technology","SpeedGene -- a compression algorithm for the fast and efficient storage of next generation genetic sequence data in an existing hardware environment","Lange, Christoph","MARKETS ADDRESSED:The pedigree file-format is one of the most commonly used input formats for genetic data analysis softwares, e.g. FBAT, PBAT, PLINK. For high-throughput sequencing data and data from genome-wide association studies, the sizes of these pedigree files can reach several terabytes. Unnecessarily large files result in waste of disk space and computation time, e.g. loading time during analysis.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:To solve the problem of large file sizes and long loading times of pedigree files for GWAS studies and next-generation sequencing studies, researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health have developed a new compression algorithm -- SpeedGene – that includes an optimized ”storage-and-load” algorithm for genetic data. The new algorithm performs better than currently available compression formats for pedigree files by several magnitudes. Depending on the minor allele frequency, the SpeedGene algorithm selects among three different compression methods to minimize disk and memory storage space. The compression factor of the algorithm depends on the genotype frequency distribution of the markers and the number of subjects in the dataset and could range from 16 to several hundred, which potentially allows genomic data of thousands of people to be stored with only hundreds of megabytes of space. SpeedGene is currently implemented as a C++ library, and could be readily incorporated into common software programs for association studies, where the genetic information could be loaded using the library and directly sent for analysis.The SpeedGene format does not require any CPU-time for decompression, and the storage structure of the genotypes allows fast computation of permutation methods. The library provides functions for loading the compressed files and retrieving any part of the original data. Furthermore, the implementation supports parallel processing of the dataset, i.e., loading of subsets of markers. This greatly decreases the loading time when parallel jobs are dispatched in clusters. In conclusion, the SpeedGene library enables the storage and analysis of next generation sequencing data in existing hardware environment, making system upgrades unnecessary."," Genomics/Proteomics  |   Software/Algorithms  |   Bioinformatics","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=4173","Grant Zimmermann, (617) 495-3067","Harvard University"
"21170","Licensable Technology","Sperm Sorting Using Fertility Chip with Lensless Imaging System","Kayaalp, Emre ; Safaee, Hooman ; Zhang, Xiaohui ; Tasoglu, Savas ; Demirci, Utkan ; Catalano, Paolo Nicolas","Technology:
The invention combines two existing technologies, a microfluidic chip and a lensless charge coupled device (CCD) to enable sorting and tracking of sperm simultaneously. Currently, there are no approved technologies for the sorting and collection of the most motile sperm individually to address the fundamental problem of sperm quality during in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intra cytoplasmic sperm injections (ICSI). 

This imaging system has a wide field of view (FOV)-approximately 20 times that of a conventional 10x objective lens. Consequently, the spermatozoa stay within the CCD view window longer than under a microscope. Thus, this integrated imaging system significantly improves the detection efficiency for high motility sperm at the outlet of a microfuidic chip (p<0.01). This imaging technology can automatically record, track, quantify, sort and extract high quality sperm individually, by tracing the shadow paths for individual sperm. 

This technology could prove especially useful for pateint samples with low sperm counts (oligozoospermia),low seminal volume(hypospermia) and low sperm motility (oligospermaesthenia, astenozoospermia).


Applications:
Use in IVF Clinic: During IVF or ICSI, to increase the pregnancy rates when sperm numbers or motility is very low and for counting and extraction of most motile sperm from cryopreserved sperm population.


Advantages: 
1.	Simple and Easy: Eliminates the need for microscopic/fluorescent imaging.

2.	Rapid and Efficient: Reduces the time for cell capture, imaging and counting to a few minutes when compared to existing swim-up method and minimizes operator error.

3.	High Yield: High recovery of sperms with good motility and survival from samples with a very low sperm density.

4.	Higher Quality:	Clean sorted sample product, selection of sperm with the highest motility avoids cell-to-cell contact with defective sperm or leukocytes.

5.	Vertical orientation: 	Sorting is done against gravitational field alike, sperm movement in swim-up method and in the female reproductive tract in vivo.

The exterior envelope glycoprotein, gp120, and the transmembrane envelope glycoprotein, gp41, are derived from a labile gp160 precursor.  Oligomeric, soluble envelope glycoproteins mimic the native envelope glycoprotein spikes on virions; they are therefore preferred to their monomeric counterparts as immunogens. This technology is based upon the finding that the introduction of cysteine residues into specific locations within gp41 converts the normally labile HIV-1 gp160 into a stable disulfide-linked oligomer.  This stabilized form of gp160 holds promise in the development of an HIV vaccine.                       Applications/Advantages:  The lability of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein has hampered preparation of high-quality stable oligomers, which are in turn useful for both vaccine development and structural studies.  Disulfide crosslinking of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein oligomer stabilizes otherwise labile HIV neutralization epitopes.  Further, biologically irrelevant epitopes that are exposed on the gp120 or gp160 monomer are buried and therefore masked with the oligomeric form.

The wireless location system includes signal collection systems and location processors for processing digital data provided by the signal collection systems. The station-based method comprises receiving a transmission from a wireless transmitter at multiple antennas and at multiple signal collection systems. The transmission is converted into a digital format in a receiver connected to each antenna at the multiple signal collection systems. At each signal collection system, digital data representative of the received transmissions are stored in a memory. The transmission is then demodulated at a first signal collection system, and appropriate phase correction intervals are determined. At the first signal collection system, for each such phase correction interval, appropriate phase correction parameters are calculated, and the phase correction parameters are encoded along with the demodulated data. The demodulated data and phase correction parameters are sent from the first signal collection system to a location processor. At the location processor, the signal collection systems and receiving antennas to use in location processing are determined. The demodulated data and any needed phase correction parameters are then sent from the location processor to a plurality of signal collection systems that will be used in location processing.

"MCL 3182.0","Licensable Technology","Stem Cell Method for Treating Neurodegenerative Diseases","Anne M. Cataldo, Ph.D.","The remediation of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's Disease and other neurodegenerative disorders remains a challenge. Among methods that have been tried, with little success to date, are various methods of cell therapy, wherein cells would be implanted into the brain of affected patients in an attempt to overcome loss of functional neurons. Evidence in the literature suggests that adult bone marrow stem cells can transdifferentiate into different neuronal phenotypes. However, therapeutic methods involving marrow-derived multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs) have not yet been worked out. The inventors have shown that the º-secretase-cleaved fragment of the amyloid precursor protein (sAPPº), a potent neurotrophic factor, can potentiate the nerve growth factor/retinoic acid induced transdifferentiation of MAPCs into neural progenitor cells. Specifically, MAPCs engineered to express sAPPº, when administered intravenously, cross the blood brain barrier and terminally differentiate into cholinergic neurons. MAPCs differentiated in the presence of sAPPº and NGF/RA exhibited a 40-75% increase in expression of neuronal markers compared to MAPCs differentiated by NGF/RA alone. 
     Potential Commercial Uses: The invention therefore comprises methods of treating neurodegenerative diseases by using MAPCs as vehicles of trophic factor delivery. Specifically, recombinant MAPCs, engineered to express sAPPº, can be administered to patients so that the MAPCs can differentiate into cholinergic neurons in the brain. The method is potentially useful for a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and other diseases characterized by loss of neuronal function.

Stem cells potentially have a high therapeutic value to treat a variety of diseases. We disclose novel related stem cell technologies to address effective drug discovery, toxicology testing and cardiac disease therapy.

1. Ventricular cardiomyocytes are used as parental cells in a process to generate large numbers of ventricular induced pluripotent cells (iPS), that are then differentiated into secondary ventricular cardiomyocytes, at a 10-fold increase in number. This is a platform technology, as large numbers of specialized cells could be derived from other organs using this method. 

2. Human primordial heart progenitor cells which can generate diverse cardiovascular cell lineages have been isolated. Using them, vascularized human heart tissue has been generated. These cells can be used for transplantation, or as models of vascular disease. 
3. Subpopulations of cardiac progenitor cells exhibiting restricted capacity to differentiate into the heart?s three major cell types (cardiomyocytes, endothelial, and smooth muscle cells) without risk of teratoma formation in mouse have been identified.

4. A subset of cardiac progenitor cells specific for the atria has been identified, which may replace fibroblasts in current protocols. A stress-related transcription factor key to the survival of cells has also been identified; its activators may prevent early cardiac cell death in transplantation caused by the mechanical stress of heart beating.

5. Protocols to expand these cells in culture while maintaining their pluripotency have been developed, offering for the first time a method of generating a renewable source of ventricular and atrial progenitor cells ideally suited for cardiac tissue engineering. 

6. Improved biomaterials capable of directing spatially aligned growth and/or differentiation of grafted progenitor cells have been generated. These reproduce critical aspects of the heart?s extracellular matrix which influences cellular morphology, while organizing neighboring cells into functional networks. These advances in bioengineering could be applied to any disease states in which grafted cell populations must functionally integrate within complex three-dimensional organ structures. 

Applications:

- Cardio-toxicology testing in drug discovery
- Preclinical evaluation/screening of small molecule therapeutics
- Treatment of degenerative cardiac disease 
- Tissue engineering and cell-based therapies 

Advantages:

- Platform technology consisting of novel cardiac progenitor cells, differentiated cell types and biomaterials for growth and differentiation.

"CCMC   1183","Licensable Technology","Stimulating Axon Regeneration by Blocking EGF Receptor Activity","He, Zhigang","Inhibitory molecules associated with myelin and the glial scar limit axon regeneration in the adult central nervous system (CNS), but the underlying signaling mechanisms of regeneration inhibition are not fully understood. Dr. He has shown that suppressing the kinase function of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) blocks the activities of both myelin inhibitors and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans in inhibiting neurite outgrowth. In addition, regeneration inhibitors trigger the phosphorylation of EGFR in a calcium-dependent manner. Local administration of EGFR inhibitors promotes significant regeneration of injured optic nerve fibers, pointing to a promising therapeutic avenue for enhancing axon regeneration after CNS injury. ||

To confirm our observations, Dr. He's lab tested two well-characterized EGFR inhibitors, a competitive inhibitor AG1478, and an irreversible inhibitor PD168393 (18) in neurite outgrowth assays. Both inhibitors effectively promoted neurite outgrowth from both CGNs and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons when grown on an immobilized substrate of either whole myelin or individual myelin inhibitors. In contrast, none of the treatments affected neurite outgrowth on a control poly- D-lysine (PDL) substrate. Similarly, EGFR kinase inhibitors were able to block neurite outgrowth inhibition by myelin in retinal explant cultures grown in a collagen matrix laden with myelin. Although retinal explants are mixtures of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and other cells, dissociated cultures contained primarily CGNs and DRG neurons. Thus, it is likely that EGFR inhibitors act directly on neurons to block their inhibitory responses to myelin inhibitors."," Therapeutics - Drugs  |   Research Tools  |   Therapeutics - Drugs","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=1183","Caron, Connie, connie.caron@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"

"3763","Licensable Technology","Sugar production from photosynthetic bacteria","Way, Jeffrey Charles","MARKETS ADDRESSED:The need for biofuels is becoming more urgent with the increase in global warming, decreasing availability of easily accessed petroleum, and the rise of former third-world countries with an immense demand for oil.  Many systems for production of biofuels involve the metabolic conversion of carbohydrates into fuel, resulting in increased demand for carbohydrates such as sugars.  Researchers at the Wyss Institute have developed a photosynthetic bacterium that directs much of its metabolic output into the synthesis and secretion of sucrose, or table sugar.  This bacterium should enable the production of sugar in colder climates where sugarcane cannot be grown, such as most of the US.The world-wide market for sugar is approximately $60 billion.  Significant growth in US demand is expected over the next decade due to government mandates for biofuel use (the National Renewable Fuel Standard).  Currently, the primary biofuel in the US is ethanol generated by fermentation of sugars derived from corn.  Attempts to convert cellulosic biomass into biofuels have met with serious technical problems.  Outside the US, sugar is primarily produced from sugarcane, which can only be grown in tropical climates, so that a limited number of countries such as Brazil dominate sugar production.  While the food market for sugar is relatively flat, the increased demand for biofuels will accelerate the demand for carbohydrates.The US market for sugar.  New governmental mandates (the National Renewable Fuel Standard) are expected to increase the demand for sugar that can be processed into biofuels (Sources:  EPA web site, document EPA-420-F-09-023; “Sugar Backgrounder”, USDA document SSS-249-01; and MIT Energy Club Units & Coversions Fact Sheet.)INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic bacteria that use the same biochemical systems as green plants for capturing light energy and fixing CO2.  These bacteria grow quite rapidly in comparison to plants, doubling in mass every ~12-24 hours.  Their only nutrients are sunlight, CO2, water, and minerals.  These bacteria respond by producing internal sucrose in response to certain environmental conditions.To harness this phenomenon for large-scale carbohydrate production, we engineered a novel photosynthetic bacterium to produce and secrete high levels of sucrose – in initial experiments, about 50% of the energy that is normally devoted to producing more bacterial biomass is now directed into sugar production.  Moreover, because the sucrose is secreted, continuous harvesting of the product is possible.Production of sucrose from engineered photosynthetic bacteria.  When production is induced in the engineered strain, about 50% of the energy captured from photons is directed into sucrose synthesis.  Overall productivity of the system is also increased."," Energy","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3763","Jessica Duda, (617) 495-3067","Harvard University"

The extraordinary enhancement of photonic transport through substantially sub-wavelength sized holes in symmetric metallic films due to this resonance has immense promise in fields such as data storage, photolithography, ultra-high resolution optical microscopy and single molecule biosensing. Unfortunately, symmetric conductive films, while collecting photons over a large area (compared to the wavelength of the irradiance) also emit the photons on the non-irradiated side over an area that is similarly larger than the wavelength. A new light source has been invented that maintains the extraordinary photonic transport through sub-wavelength apertures while constraining the emission on the non-irradiated side to the aperture. The light emitted from these devices appears to violate Rayleigh's criterion for two (or more) sources. The direct implication for this is that such apertures do not entirely act as point sources, instead, they emit semi-collimated light and because the emitted light is propagating, and not evanescent, this device can be used in the far-field."," Electrical Engineering  |   Nanotechnology/NEMS  |   Electrical Engineering","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=1808","Alan Gordon, (617) 384-5000","Harvard University"

Inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a, IL-1ß, IL-6, VEGF, and many more have been implicated as the culprits for the sepsis syndrome and its associated features. Attempts to modulate the inflammatory cascade have been largely unsuccessful, including trials of corticosteroids, antiendotoxin antibodies, TNF-a antagonists, IL-1 receptor antagonists, ibuprofen, and extracorporeal blood modification. One reason for their failure may be that the pathophysiology of sepsis syndrome changes over time. The early phase is characterized by a surge of inflammatory cytokines and the later phase shifts toward an immunosuppressive state developing and is mediated by anti-inflammatory cytokines. ||

Based on the above information, the Kohane laboratory is developing immune-modulating extracorporeal circuits for sepsis that selectively filter deleterious cytokines. These circuits are highly selective and their effect is limited to the time that they are in use (i.e. during the appropriate phase of the sepsis syndrome).

Given that vessels are typically hand sewn during anastomosis procedures, these procedures are oftentimes only performed by a minority of surgeons in specialized centers, as these procedures are time-consuming, technically demanding and prone to complications. The investigator has invented a simple device that may be used to perform rapid anastomosis of two vessels. The device would maintain the vessel ends in a coapted and sealed arrangement. 

Application: 
The device may be used in performing vascular anastomosis procedures, particularly microvascular anastomosis procedures.

- Technical imperfections during the traditional hand-sewing process can lead to thrombosis and eventual tissue loss. The device may allow for more precise anastomosis, which could translate into a lower rate of anastomotic failure. Additionally, the device would hold the anastomotic site open mechanically, which may reduce the occurrence of thrombotic complications.

The inventors have developed a Synchronized Intraventricular Balloon Assistance Device (SIBAD) that can help assist the pumping of a weakened heart.  The ventricular chamber of the heart pumps oxygenated blood from the lung to the body.  Heart-weakening due to heart disease or heart attack will prevent proper heart pumping, resulting in insufficient supply of oxygenated blood to the body.  The invention is a simply designed device that utilizes the heart?s own energy to assist pumping.
	Heart failure caused by heart diseases and heart attack is recognized as a serious public health problem.  Currently, Ventricular Assistance Device (VAD) is used to support blood flow in people with weakened hearts.  Available VAD?s designs feature a power source (batteries) connected to a control unit that monitors the VAD?s function.  Such designs will involve the eventual replacement of batteries, which may require a surgical procedure that could lead to potential infections and other complications.  SIBAD is designed to provide a solution for this problem?to assist heart pumping with less reliance on external energy source and maintenance surgery.  Additionally, cost is one of the limiting factors that are impeding the treatment of children with weakened hearts in the developing world.  The low cost of SIBAD can overcome this cost barrier.
 
Applications:  
?	Used in patients with moderate to severe heart valve defects 
?	Used as a bridge-to-transplantation or bridge-to-recovery for some patients
?	Used in patients with weakened ventricular heart chambers due to heat attack or heart diseases
?	Used in patients with heart rhythm disorder

Advantages:  
?	Low Cost:  The simple design will translate to low production cost
?	Low Maintenance: Compared to current, similar devices in the market, the technology does not require external power source, and is expected to incur less maintenance procedure, e.g. surgery, that could lead to complications.

The small molecule libraries have exhaustive variation at every sp3-hybridized center.  The system is not limited to the synthesis of libraries of peptide mimics-encompasses the broader concept of providing any collection (peptidomimetics and non-peptidomimetics) of chemical compounds having stereodiversity.  The monomers can also be obtained in high yield. Libraries of compounds generated from the synthetic platform are to be screened for their biological efficacy and lead compounds are to be formulated and utilized as therapeutic pharmaceuticals for treatment and prevention of disease.  More particularly, peptide therapies are heavily invested in the treatment of autoimmune diseases.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Although peptides have shown some promise in clinical trials as therapeutic agents, its success has largely been limited by several factors, including rapid degradation by peptidases, poor cell permeability, and a lack of binding specificity resulting from conformational inflexibility.  Over the years research has overcome some of these limitations with peptidomimetics-a system for the production of modified chemical compounds capable of mimicking the structural and or functional properties of peptides.   In most cases, peptidomimetic compounds are prepared one at a time.  A few researchers have attempted to design combinatorial strategies to generate peptidomimetic libraries, but these methods are limited by lack of stereochemical complexity and a restricted ability to substitute base molecules.  Also, a fixed structure to mimic the peptide bond does not allow subsequent modification and diversification of the structure.  As a consequence, there is a particular need for synthetic strategies capable of producing complex, highly diversified libraries of compounds that act as peptidominetics.  There is also a high-demand for methods and compounds that allow significant stereochemical control and functional group diversity in the production of such libraries.  The laboratory of Professor Gregory Verdine had developed a novel modular synthetic mechanism for preparing and screening libraries of peptidomimetics with all possible stereoisomers.   The platform includes a semirigid acyclic framework (cis-enediol unit), which, from the standpoint of biological potency, is especially important for proper discovery of lead compounds.  This framework is rich in stereoisogenic centers with a hydrocarbon framework presenting both hydrogen-bonding functionality and variable side-chain (""R"") groups.

Currently, anti-angiogenesis drugs are mainly developed for cancer treatment. In 2010, there are an estimated 24.6 million people in the world living with cancer. Cancer is responsible for 25% of all deaths in the United States and 13% worldwide.The targeted cancer drug market will double in value, from $25 billion in 2008 to $51 billion in 2015. Angiogenesis inhibitor has about 20% of the market currently. Cortistatins, which are isolated from the marine sponge Corticium simplex, have been shown as potent angiogenesis inhibitors. However, isolation of cortistatins from the natural source is impractical for large scale production.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Chemists in the Myers and Shair laboratories have developed a method to synthesize cortistatins and analogs at a multi-gram level. A synthetic route that provides a compound considered to be the core of the cortistatins has been developed. This core could be used to produce natural and artificial cortistatins, as well as cortistatins tagged with markers for use in target identification experiments. These compounds may be used to screen biological activity toward angiogenesis inhibition and study the relationship between the molecular structure and inhibition activities. This research can lead to better designs of angiogenesis inhibitors for cancer treatment."," Drug Discovery Tools  |   Drug Discovery Tools  |   Drug Discovery Tools","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3219","Vivian Berlin, (617) 496-0474","Harvard University"

"6781T","Licensable Technology","System employing dissipative pseudorandom dynamics for communications and measurement","Gershenfeld, Neil  A","A communication and/or measurement system includes a transmitter that modulates a pseudo-random noise signal with a message signal to produce a wideband signal for transmission. A receiver, which demodulates the wideband signal to recover the message signal, includes an ""analog"" feedback shift register that reproduces the noise signal based on samples of the received signal. The analog feedback shift register (""AFSR"") is a generalization of a linear feedback shift register (""LFSR""). The AFSR is characterized by a function that agrees with the function that characterizes the LFSR, at the points at which that function is defined. Further, the AFSR characterizing function has stable fixed points at these values, i.e., it has a slope of less than one in these regions. Specifically, the AFSR's function has stable fixed points at integer values and unstable fixed points at half-integer values and, the stable fixed points act as attractors. The AFSR thus produces a sequence that relaxes to the nearest integer-valued sequence. One example of such a function is: ##EQU1## where the .alpha..sub.i 's are the coefficients of the maximum length polynomial used to produce the wide-band noise signal and y.sub.n-1 is the state of the (n-i).sup.th stage of the register. As long as the samples of received signal that are fed to the AFSR fall within the basins of attraction that surround the stable values, the AFSR can accurately determine the expected next state of the shift register.

"6781T","Licensable Technology","System employing dissipative pseudorandum dynamics for communications and measurement","Gershenfeld, Neil  A","An optical communication and/or measurement system includes a transmitter that modulates a pseudo-random noise signal with a message signal to produce a wideband signal for transmission. A receiver, which demodulates the wideband signal to recover the message signal, includes an ""analog"" feedback shift register (""AFSR"") that reproduces the noise signal based on samples of the received signal. The AFSR is a generalization of a linear feedback shift register (""LFSR""). The AFSR is characterized by a function that agrees with the function that characterizes the LFSR, at the points at which that function is defined. The AFSR includes beam splitters that are spaced in accordance with the associated pseudorandom code. The AFSR's function has stable fixed points at integer values and unstable fixed points at half-integer values and, the stable fixed points act as attractors. The AFSR thus produces a sequence that relaxes to the nearest integer-valued sequence. As long as the samples of received signal that are fed to the AFSR fall within the basins of attraction that surround the stable values, the AFSR can accurately determine the expected next state of the shift register. While this can be done explicitly, the AFSR merges the symbol parsing, acquisition, tracking and update rules into a simple governing equation. The AFSR will thus entrain and produce an optical binary-valued pseudo-random noise signal.","   |   ","http://www.ipvisioninc.com/findurl.php?uid=mitDossier:6781T","Jack Turner","Massachusetts Institute of Technology"

Alignment of the stamp and any previously patterned features on the substrate is accomplished with an X-Y translation stage or other suitable mechanism. If an optically clear stamp is utilized, features in the stamp and the substrate can be compared simultaneously and the relative position adjusted. In another aspect, a pattern in a thin film of liquid is created by liquid embossing on an offset substrate.

"6262T","Licensable Technology","System for encoding image data into multiple layers representing regions of coherent motion and associated motion parameters","Adelson, Edward  H; Wang, John Y.A.","A system stores images as a series of layers by determining (i) the boundaries of regions of coherent motion over the entire image, or frame, sequence; and (ii) associated motion parameters, or coefficients of motion equations, that describe the transformations of the regions from frame to frame. The system first estimates motion locally, by determining the movements within small neighborhoods of pixels from one image frame i to the next image frame i+1, to develop an optical flow, or dense motion, model of the image. Next, the system estimates the motion using affine or other low order, smooth transformations within a set of regions which the system has previously identified as having coherent motion, i.e., identified by analyzing the motions in the frames i-1 and i. It groups, or clusters, similar motion models and iteratively produces an updated set of models for the image. The system then uses the local motion estimates to associate individual pixels in the image with the motion model that most closely resembles the pixel's movement, to update the regions of coherent motion. Using these updated regions, the system iteratively updates its motion models and, as appropriate, further updates the coherent motion regions, and so forth. The system then does the same analysis for the remaining frames. The system next segments the image into regions of coherent motion and defines associated layers in terms of (i) pixel intensity values, (ii) associated motion model parameters, and (iii) order in ""depth"" within the image."," ","http://www.ipvisioninc.com/findurl.php?uid=mitDossier:6262T","Jack Turner","Massachusetts Institute of Technology"

These applications require a device that can sense and capture an image.  For example, a charge-coupled device (CCD) is included in many imaging devices, such as cell phones and security cameras.  However, several problems may occur due to low resolution CCD devices, since text can become degraded by blurring due to the distance of the document from the imaging device, poor resolution due to insufficient sensor outputs from the imaging device, and uncorrelated noise from a variety of sources, including, but not limited to, noise due to sensor behavior in low light environments.  These degradations may be so great as to render the text contained within the photograph illegible.Invention:This invention discloses a system that extracts from text from an image.  The system includes a capture device that captures the image having a low resolution. An image segmentation subsystem partitions the image into image segments.  An image restoration subsystem generates a resolution-expanded image from the image segments and negates degradation effects of the low-resolution image by transforming the image segments from a first domain to a second domain and deconvolving the transformed image segments in the second domain to determine parameters of the low-resolution image. A text recognition subsystem  transforms the restored image data into computer readable text data based on the determined parameters."," Photonics/Optical Systems  |   Sensing/Imaging","http://www.tufts.biz/cgi-bin/tech_search.cgi?r=1&case=T001494","Martin Son617-636-3605martin.son@tufts.edu","Tufts University"

The imaging system integrates a wide-field, low-resolution imaging modality with a high-resolution, narrow-field imaging modality through a unique optical arrangement utilizing a common light source and hardware control unit.  The wide-field view is displayed on a computer screen and user can (point-and-click) on a feature of interest to obtain a high-resolution image of that feature.  The high-resolution image of the feature pops up on the computer screen and the user can toggle back-and-forth between wide-field and high-resolution images or view them side-by-side.  Combining wide-field and narrow-field imaging into one unit solves the problem of spending time relocating the area of interest when switching between fields and modalities.

Once the user has selected the interesting features to view at high-resolution, the images can be saved digitally and added to an electronic medical record along with diagnostic notes if needed.  Multiple product configurations are available, ranging from the simplest combination of reflectance microscopy as both the wide-field and high-resolution modalities to combinations derived from the following lists.

Of the many risk factors for CVDs, conditions featuring metabolic dis-regulation, including hypertension, elevated blood glucose and/or lipid levels, diabetes, and obesity, are among the most common, with diabetes and obesity being epidemic in their own right. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates there to be approximately 26 million diabetics in the United States alone, with a staggering 79 million additional individuals estimated to be pre-diabetic.The Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein (SREBP) family of transcription factors controls cholesterol and lipid homeostasis, adipocyte differentiation, and mediates lipogenic aspects of insulin-dependent gene expression. Obesitydue to imbalances in lipid metabolism and elevated blood sugar due to diabetes are both serious conditions to which SREBP family members are intimately linked, being strong risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension and atherosclerosis. SREBPs have also been functionally linked to many metabolic diseases that are co-morbidities with CVDs. One evidence being, cholesterol-lowering statins which target HMG-CoA reductase- a key enzyme which is transcriptionally controlled by SREBP.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:While most therapeutic approaches aimed at altering gene expression programs target upstream signaling pathways or nuclear translocation checkpoints, Scientists at the Wagner lab  have provided mechanistic insights supporting an alternative approach, which is aimed at directly inhibiting the interaction of the SREBP transactivation domains (TADs) in the nucleus.Scientists at the Wagner lab developed a dual-probe fluorescence polarization (FP)-based high-throughput assay to screen for small-molecule inhibitors that block SREBP directly.

"3059","Licensable Technology","Targeting anti-cancer drugs intracellularly via TRP channels","Bean, Bruce P.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:The strategy promises to open up a large new chemical space of potential anti-cancer agents, i.e. cationic molecules that are too poorly permeant to be effective unless introduced by permeation through TRP channels. Many cancer cells express in their plasma membrane large-pore cation channels such as TRP channels and P2X-receptor channels. Mining existing gene expression profiling data from patients with a variety of cancer types, a sub-group of basal-like breast cancers have increased expression of TRPM8, as do a number of prostate cancers, some of which also have increased expression of TRPV1 channels. This in silico analysis has also revealed that melanomas have increased expression of TRPV2 channels and neuroblastomas express P2X7 channels, which are large-pore channels gated by ATP.  Work assessing the ability of agonists of TRPM8 and TRPV1 to functionally activate these channels in a number of breast and prostate cancer cell lines is ongoing.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Recent results show that TRPV1 channels form pores that are sufficiently large to allow entry of a charged derivative of lidocaine, which can be selectively introduced into TRPV1-expressing pain-sensing neurons by co-application with capsaicin, an agonist that opens TRPV1 channels. Evidence for expression of a variety of TRP channels in cancer cells, including TRPV1 and TRPM8 channels in prostate cancer cells, TRPM8 channels in basal-like breast cancer cells, and TRPV2 channels in melanomas exists in the literature. Data suggests that adriamycin, a positively charged anti-proliferative agent, can permeate through TRPV1 channels when the channels are opened by capsaicin. Synthesis and screening for novel charged molecules with cytotoxic or anti-proliferative properties that are unable to enter cells except when TRP channels are activated by a co-applied agonist is possible, thus targeting them selectively to TRP-expressing cancer cells.  A method to selectively introduce charged sodium channel blocking molecules into pain-sensing neurons by way of TRPV1 channels, which are strongly expressed in nociceptors but have little expression in other types of neurons has recently been developed. Data shows that the pore of TRP channels is large enough pass QX-314, a charged derivative of lidocaine that is ineffective from the outside but blocks sodium channels (and therefore excitability) from the inside of cells. This allows selective inhibition of pain signals without producing general numbness or blocking motor neurons.With the knowledge that a variety of cancer cells express TRP channels and other large-pore cation channels such as P2X7 ATP-gated channels, a similar strategy to selectively introduce into cancer cells charged molecules that are cytotoxic or antiproliferative when inside the cells but relatively innocuous outside. Co-applying such a compound together with an agonist for TRP or other large-pore channels present on the tumor cell would preferentially potentiate cytotoxicity in tumor cells that overexpress the large-pore channel, but have less effect on normal cells that either do not express such channels or express them at lower density.Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) is a widely used chemotherapeutic agent that is relatively small (543 daltons) and is positively charged, making it an excellent candidate for transport via TRP channels or other large-pore cation channels. Although adriamycin is highly effective in many diseases (e.g., leukemia, breast cancer), the total dose that can be given is limited by a cumulative cardiotoxicity. Therefore, preferentially facilitating tumor cell uptake may improve the therapeutic index of this very important chemotherapeutic agent.As a proof-of-concept, the Bean/Woolf labs have performed preliminary experiments testing whether it is possible to enhance adriamycin entry into cells through TRP channels (See Figure below). With a brief exposure to a low concentration of adriamycin applied together with capsaicin, there is entry of adriamycin into N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells that have been transfected with TRPV1. Adriamycin enters only cells that have been successfully transfected with TRPV1, and entry requires exposure to capsaicin (not shown). The simplest interpretation is that adriamycin enters directly through activated TRPV1 channels.We are currently testing for enhanced cell death produced by adriamycin entry through TRP channels natively expressed in several types of cancer cells, starting with prostate cancer cells that endogenously express TRPV1.  Another early focus will be basal-like breast cancer cells that express TRPM8 channels, using agonists for TRPM8 applied with adriamycin, since adriamycin is already used clinically against such cancers.  Even a small increase in the potency of adriamycin's action produced by enhanced entry through TRP channels would be very important clinically due to the low margin of safety with this drug."," ","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3059","Michal Preminger, (617) 432-0920","Harvard University"
"1872","Licensable Technology","Targeting FtsZ activity using novel antibacterials","Kirschner, Marc W.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Compounds targeting FtsZ may be developed as broad spectrum antibacterials, relevant to both gram positive and gram negative bacteria.  Increasing numbers of drug-resistant infections, including MRSA and a shortage of pipeline development by pharmaceuticals have created significant opportunities for novel antibacterials.  The CDC estimates that 2 million individuals will acquire a hospital bacterial infection annually, with 90,000 of these cases resulting in death.  Overall, the total market for antibacterials is valued at approximately $25B, with the hospital anti-bacterial market representing $8B.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Inhibition of bacterial septation machinery represents a promising approach for countering antibiotic-resistant bacteria.  One such approach targets FtsZ, an essential protein and key mediator of bacterial cell division, which is highly conserved in prokaryotes, yet absent in the mitochondria of higher eukaryotes.  Since FtsZ consumes GTP during the cytokinetic FtsZ ring (Z-ring) assembly, much like its eukaryotic analog tubulin during microtubule dynamics in mitosis, it is susceptible to inactivation by compounds that interfere with its assembly-dependent GTPase activity.  These compounds present striking parallels to microtubule-targeting anti-mitotic drugs, whereby FtsZ inhibitors either hyperstabilize or destabilize FtsZ filaments, much like how Taxol and vinblastine hyperstabilize or destabilize microtubules in cancer cells, respectively.   Early efforts to target FtsZ have been hindered by few high affinity hits and a general lack of mechanistic understanding of how small molecules perturbed FtsZ assembly in vitro and in vivo.  Here, new biochemical and whole cell screens developed by RayChaudhuri and Kirschner have uncovered an unprecedented number of small molecules inhibiting FtsZ, as well as potentially other essential bacterial septation proteins.  This rich harvest of inhibitors suggests promising opportunities to expand screening with new chemical libraries."," ","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=1872","Michal Preminger, (617) 432-0920","Harvard University"

It is anticipated that MEF2A (myocyte enhancer factor 2A), mechanisms will also lead to new diagnostic tools for the study of synaptic development and function, spanning both CNS drug discovery and neurodevelopmental research.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Post-synaptic differentiation of dendrites is an essential step in synapse formation and is intrinsic to neural reprogramming following CNS trauma or neurodegenerative disease.  Investigators from Harvard Medical School have discovered an important molecular switch of the transcription factor known as MEF2A, which is able to modulate dendritic plasticity in CNS granule neurons.  Functional analysis has pinpointed this switch to lysine-403, where sumoylation enhances morphogenesis of dendritic claws, while acetylation inhibits it.  Moreover, the decision for either sumoylation or acetylation is traced to the phosphorylation status of a neighboring serine residue.   This highly specific mechanism of post-synaptic plasticity underscores promising opportunities for modulating MEF2A through a variety of small molecule drugs."," Therapeutics - Drugs","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=2627","Michal Preminger, (617) 432-0920","Harvard University"

This makes it harder for any medicines to treat fungal infections since what harms the fungi may harm the plant or human. Once our body is exposed to fungal infection, our immune system dispels white blood cells and releases reactive oxygen species (ROS) to fight the infection. This invention uses a whole animal assay to identify YAP1 as a gene that tells the fungus to “fight back” and neutralize the ROS so that infection may persist. This invention may be used to develop a drug that disables Yap1 from neutralizing ROS thereby abrogating the infectious disease process.

Worldwide sales of linezolid (Zyvox, Pfizer) were $1.14B in 2009, and daptomycin (Cubicin, Cubist) generated $521M in sales in 2009.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:•     Novel antibiotic against MRSA with sub-micromolar MIC•     Potent small molecule inhibitor of wall teichoic acid (WTA) biosynthesis--an unexploited antibiotic target in Gram-positive bacteria•     Tested in murine model of endophthalmitis, and MSSA and MRSA isolates from cases of bacterial keratitis•     Total synthesis of Targocil, focus library of analogs, and comprehensive SAR data•     Target validated•     Non-toxic in mice at doses of 75 mg/kgKeratitis is an infection of the cornea that occurs following injury or in association with contact lens wear, and S. aureus is a leading cause. Prof. Suzanne Walker has developed Targocil, a novel antibiotic against MRSA. In collaboration with Dr. Michael Gilmore of Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, they have shown the effects of Targocil in murine model of endophthalmitis, and also tested the efficacies of Targocil for a panel of MSSA and MRSA isolates from cases of bacterial keratitis. It was found that Targocil is more effective than vancomycin in blocking intracellular S. aureus growth. Moreover, resistant mutants that arise upon selection with these compounds are highly attenuated and show reduced epithelial cell binding and invasion.Wall teichoic acid (WTA) is a cell surface glycopolymer found in Gram-positive bacteria, such as S. aureus. Currently an unexploited antibiotic target, WTA has been proposed as a virulence factor because knocking out the first gene (tarO) of the WTA biosynthetic pathway prevents infection. The Walker lab has shown that Targocil is an inhibitor of TarG, the transmembrane component of the two component ABC transporter that exports WTAs from the cytoplasm to the external surface of the bacterial membrane where they are attached to peptidoglycan.  Targocil has minimally inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.3 uM. Targocil shows inhibitory activities against both methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains. The acute toxicity of Targocil has been tested: doses of 75 mg/kg administered via tail vein injection caused no adverse effects in mice after 24 h. Total synthetic method of Targocil and its analogs has been determined."," Therapeutics - Drugs","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3242","Vivian Berlin, (617) 496-0474","Harvard University"

The recombinant utilizes the tetracycline-inducible transcription switch (T-RExTM gene switch technology licensed by Brigham and Women's Hospital to Invitrogen) developed by the inventor as a research tool for use in mammalian cells.  Infection of normal replicating cells as well as multiple human cancer cell types with KTR27 in the presence of tetracycline led to 1000- to 250,000-fold higher progeny virus production than in the absence of tetracycline.  Removal of tetracycline can quickly and efficiently shut down replication of KTR27 in infected cell cultures.  KTR27 is avirulent following intracerebral inoculation whether in mice receiving a standard diet or a doxycycline-containing diet.  The therapeutic efficacy of KTR27 as a novel oncolytic agent against tumors was also evaluated in vivo. Intratumoral inoculation of tumors with KTR27 inhibited their growth in a xenograft model of human lung cancer in nude mice. Such an inhibition was significantly more effective in mice receiving a doxycycline-containing diet than those with a standard diet.  Furthermore, in addition to inhibition of inoculated tumor growth, KTR27 also prevented growth of non-inoculated contralateral tumors in a syngeneic melanoma model in immune-competent DBA/2 mice.  KTR27 offers a unique safety feature that can limit its replication to the targeted tumor microenvironment and prevent the potential overload of progeny oncolytic viruses following oncoviral therapy. 

Application:  The oncolytic HSV-1 virus, whose replication is controlled using the tetracycline operator/repressor system, may be used to selectively treat a variety of solid tumors with minimal detrimental effect to healthy, non-cancerous cells. 

Advantages:
- This regulatable oncolytic virus minimizes the concerns regarding potential undesirable replication of oncolytic viruses in distant and adjacent tissues and the subsequent overload of progeny oncolytic viruses in the target area following the elimination of the tumor.  This unique regulatory mechanism also allows the oncolytic activity of the virus to be quickly shut down in the event adverse effects are detected in patients.

- The HSV-1 recombinant virus may have the potential to efficaciously treat many types of tumors, and can be used either alone or in combination with other therapies."," Therapeutic  |   Therapeutic","http://www.partners.org/techtransfer/availabletechnologies/default.asp","Yogesh Sharma, ysharma@partners.org, 617-954-9382","Brigham and Women's Hospital"

Dr. Yao has developed a powerful repression-based transcription switch that exploits the bacterial operon controlling tetracycline resistance to turn expression of recombinant DNA on and off in mammalian cells. The bacterial operon comprises promoter and operator elements that control expression of two proteins: the tetR protein and the operon repressor protein. In the absence of tetracycline, the repressor protein binds to the operator DNA sequence and prevents transcription of both genes. In the presence of tetracycline, the drug binds the repressor protein and causes it to detach from the operator sequence. As a result, RNA polymerase is able to bind to the promoter sequence and the tetR gene and repressor are transcribed.

Applications:

- Therapeutic vaccine production
- Drug screening


Advantages: 
- Tightly controlled inducible gene expression.
- Increased therapeutic protein production in mammalian cells.

Unlike IR, it can be used with wet or packaged samples and has at least 10x greater resolution. However, Raman microscopy suffers from low-intensity signals. A discovery in the 1970s that Raman signals can be significantly enhanced at the surface of metal nanoparticles gained considerable interest (Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy, SERS). However, this method has not been widely adapted due to the fact that not all metallic particles are made equal, having widely varying enhancement factors. Thus, there is a serious need in the field of Raman to be able to separate SERS-active (“hot”) nanoparticles from inactive ones.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Prof. Mazur has invented a new method that allows one to separate out highly-active SERS metal nanoparticles, either from solution or adhered to a surface. Metal nanoparticles, with adsorbed Raman-active molecules on their surface, are suspended within a photo-polymerizable resin (or coated with the resin on a substrate). A laser setup is used to excite the surface-attached molecules and cause them to radiate a specific frequency of light due to Raman scattering. However, only the molecules at the surface of “hot” nanoparticles (i.e. those able to enhance their radiation) produce an intense enough Raman signal to polymerize the surrounding resin. These active nanoparticles thus become coated with a cross-linked polymer, and can be selected out either by their increased mass in solution, or by their adherence to a surface. Metallic carbon nanotubes can also be separated from semiconducting ones based on their electrical conductivity using this technique. The ability to efficiently isolate metallic carbon nanotubes at a rapid rate has posed a significant challenge in the materials industry. With this sorting method, carbon nanotubes can be easily separated in solution or on a surface and be used for a variety of applications, including molecular electronic devices. The photo-polymerizable resin can even provide an electrically insulating coating for the selected particles adhered to substrates.This method allows for the separation of a large quantity of nanoparticles or nanotubes in a short period of time, at a rate on the order of one liter per second in solution. The laser setup can be tuned to accommodate the different resonances of the metallic nanoparticles and vibrational modes of the Raman-active molecules. The ability to greatly enhance Raman signals can lead to a wider array of samples than can be analyzed with Raman microscopy for applications in biology and pharmaceuticals. This method can even make single-molecule Raman detection possible."," Physics  |   Instrumentation  |   Physics  |   Photonics/Optical Systems","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3237","Alan Gordon, (617) 384-5000","Harvard University"

His device uses Fresnel zone plates that combine the microscope’s collection and spatial filtering functions  into a single element. This new device improves the image, it increases the number of samples that can be scanned, and it reduces the size of samples. In other words, researchers will no longer need a conventional microscope, or the expense associated with owning and maintaining one. Researchers will be able to perform microfluidic imaging of a variety of organisms and cells types, without one. This device also has potential to be used in lab-on-a-chip technologies. These technologies combine several laboratory processes together on a single chip. That chip can then perform diagnostics on very small volumes of fluids, cells, bacteria, and viruses. With Dr. Crozier’s new scanning microscopy, the lab-on-a-chip technologies could be less expensive, use smaller fluid samples, and be used for a broader set of organisms and cell types than current technologies. With these improvements, the diagnostic results for identification of diseases, biochemical assays, and DNA extraction can be expanded.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Fresnel zone plates use extremely short focal lengths. The Crozier lab has demonstrated that an imaging system with a short focal length zone plate, in combination with a spatial filter formed by a relay lens, can provide a high collection efficiency and high resolution. That is, a Fresnel zone plate based imaging system can perform two critical functions of a standard microscope, magnification and illumination, without a standard microscope’s pinhole aperture. Without apertures, different lenses for different apertures will not be needed to view differently sized samples. For example, scanning microscopy could be performed in parallel because the single relay lens operates as an aperture for many confocal spots simultaneously. Currently, conventional microscopes require elaborate scanning mechanisms that make parallelization and integration difficult."," Photonics/Optical Systems  |   Instrumentation","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3468","Sam Liss, (617) 495-4371","Harvard University"

Many of these preemies have difficulty feeding due to their premature development. Studies have shown that these babies have trouble coordinating their breathing as they suck and swallow milk, and will sometimes aspirate milk during feeding. In order to feed without aspirating, these babies suppress their breathing for extended periods. One solution is to provide infants with constant restricted milk flow. However, such a strategy does not help infants to learn on their own to regulate sucking and swallowing so that it does not interfere with their breathing.||

To address this problem, Dr. Eugene Goldfield, a developmental psychologist, has developed a device that monitors the sucking and breathing of newborns and “teaches” the appropriate sucking pattern depending upon the infants breathing pattern. This ""Smart Bottle"" uses a computer controller to detect respiratory patterns from information it receives from a nasal air flow sensor and compares that with information on sucking that comes from a sensor in the nipple. When an inspiration exceeds a given threshold, the computer sends a signal to a pump to provide milk flow at the level demanded by the infant. However, if the inspiration does not exceed the threshold, milk flow is reduced until breathing is returned to the threshold. This decision by the controller to pump milk is made ten times each second. ||
To evaluate the safety of the decision rules, virtual tests were carried out as well as preliminary “dry” test with a healthy term infant demonstrating the device working as intended."," Medical Devices  |   Therapeutics - Methods  |   Medical Devices","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=670","Miracco, Amy, amy.rasson@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"

This pathway is involved in the normal ''dampening'' of excitability that occurs under physiologic conditions, to maintain brain homeostasis.  However, this has never been applied to epilepsy therapeutics.  The notion is that neurons have endogenous mechanisms to ''turn down the volume'' when they get excessively active.  ||

"CCMC   2331","Licensable Technology","Therapeutic for viral infection-triggered asthma with c-Kit inhibitor","Umetsu, Dale","There are currently over 25 million individuals with asthma in the United States. Viral infections may trigger or exacerbate asthma, and represent a significant cause of morbidity. It is estimated that up to 80% of acute asthma exacerbations are the result of viral infections. Inhaled and systemic corticosteroids are effective for allergic asthma, but there is no current standard of care for viral-induced asthma, which results in high rates of hospitalization. ||

Researchers in the Umetsu lab at Boston Children’s Hospital have discovered the role of a new innate lymphoid cell type, termed natural helper cell or nuocyte, in the lungs of an experimental mouse model. They demonstrated that viral-mediated induction of airway hyper-reactivity (AHR), a defining feature of asthma, was mediated by IL-33, its receptor ST2 and natural helper cells, which express the stem cell growth factor receptor c-Kit. In their research, the use of a c-Kit kinase inhibitor was shown to greatly limit influenza-induced AHR in vivo and suppress the activity of natural helper cells in vitro. In particular, they demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of nuocyte proliferation and reduced secretion of IL-5 and IL-13, known mediators of asthma pathogenesis."," Therapeutics - Drugs","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=2331","Meyer, Abbie, abbie.meyer@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"
"21070","Licensable Technology","Therapeutic Nanoparticles for miRNA Targeted Therapy","Moore, Anna V; Medarova, Zdravka ; Yigit, Mehmet Veysel","Overview:
The inventors have developed a new therapeutic nanoparticle for microRNA (miRNA) targeted therapy. This nanoparticle includes a locked nucleic acid (LNA) or modified nucleotide element used for targeting and downregulating miRNA. The nanoparticles can be targeted to specific organs or target cells by functionalizating them with target-specific ligands and by varying the size and composition of the nanoparticles. These nanoparticles can also be imaged noninvasively, enabling image-guided delivery of the therapeutic nanoparticles.

Application:
These therapeutic nanoparticles can be used to selectively decrease cancer cell invasion or metastasis. The inventors have shown that these nanoparticles can reduce miR-10b expression by 88%, eliminating cell metastasis, and have also shown that the nanoparticles can effectively inhibit lymph tumor growth in vivo. The nanoparticles have a high affinity for cancer cells, increasing selectivity of treatment and potentially decreasing side effects associated with existing cancer therapies. The nanoparticles can also be imaged noninvasively, enabling image-guided delivery of the nanoparticles or monitoring of tumor progression. In addition to metastatic cancer, the nanoparticles can be used as therapeutics in any disease that can be manipulated at the level of miRNA expression, including cancer, diabetes, or neurological disease.

Advantages:
- The nanoparticles can be targeted to specific organs/cells by adding target-specific ligands and by varying the size and composition of the nanoparticle, resulting in increased specific accumulation of nanoparticles in target cells. 
- Targeted miRNA such as miR-10b is highly expressed in target cells and minimally expressed in healthy cells, resulting in selective treatment of target cells with minimal effects in healthy cells.
- The nanoparticles can be imaged noninvasively in vivo (e.g. using optical or MRI imaging), allowing for image-guided nanoparticle delivery or monitoring of tumor progression.

"CCMC   2304","Licensable Technology","Therapy for non-small cell lung cancer using dual EZH2 inhibition and chemotherapy","Kim, Carla","Precision medicine is widely heralded as the future for more effective cancer therapies. Trained as geneticists, members of the Kim Laboratory at Boston Children’s Hospital have discovered a useful combination of drugs for the very complex disease of non-small cell lung cancer.  While critics of precision medicine have raised concerns that this approach will take decades, the Kim Lab has a potentially groundbreaking treatment right now. ||
Epigenetic mechanisms such as histone modifications are important for the regulation of gene expression programs in metastatic and chemotherapy resistant cancer cells. High expression of EZH2, a histone-modifying enzyme of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), is observed in lung non-small cell lung cancers, correlating with high tumor grade and poor prognosis. The focus of the Kim Lab research was to find a way to incorporate the epigenetic therapy, namely inhibition of the enzyme EZH2, with current chemotherapies.   These studies link, for the first time, mutations common in lung cancer to targeted epigenetic therapies. For most targeted, or precision therapeutics so far, the mutational status of the drug target is considered.   Importantly, the genetic mutations that were biomarkers for drug efficacy were not in the gene coding the target of the epigenetic therapy.  This is a new layer to precision medicine for cancer, where considering mutations in genes other than the drug target may become very important.  ||
This study, published in Nature this January, shows that treatment with EZH2 inhibitors caused differential sensitivities to the chemotherapeutic agent etoposide; some cell lines were sensitized and others were protected from the chemotherapy treatment. Mutations in BRG1 (SMARCA4), EGFR, or B-RAF were identified as biomarkers that responsiveness to combination EZH2 inhibitor and chemotherapy treatment. Based on these findings, dual EZH2 inhibition and chemotherapy may be a viable treatment for these specific genetic subsets of lung cancers. These drugs already exist:  VP-16 is orally bio-available etoposide with full FDA approval, and specific EZH2 inhibitor is in Phase 1 clinical trials for other cancer types.  We hope to move forward with more preclinical and clinical testing of this combination, especially given that it could be a precision medicine option for up to 25% of non-small cell lung cancer patients."," Diagnostics/Biomarkers  |   Research Tools  |   Therapeutics - Drugs  |   Research Tools  |   Therapeutics - Drugs","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=2304","Meyer, Abbie, abbie.meyer@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"

A signal light beam propagating along a first SPARROW waveguide defining a throughput channel is evanescently coupled into the resonant whispering gallery modes (WGM) of the microsphere, and out of the microsphere onto a second SPARROW waveguide defining a drop channel. A secondary switching light beam is used to heat the microsphere resonator, thereby shifting its resonant frequency so that it no longer overlaps with the signal beam frequency. Light coupling into the microsphere and onto the drop channel is thus eliminated, and the signal beam is switched from the drop channel to the throughput channel. The time constant for the WGM resonant frequency shifting was about 165 ms, indicating thermo-optic switching capabilities at speeds on the order of 100 microseconds for high-Q modes.

"2270","Licensable Technology","Thinner, smoother, stronger silica wires can improve fiber optic communications and textile strength","Mazur, Eric","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Silica wires guide the transmission of light in optical communication systems, optical sensors, and other photonic applications. Dr. Mazur has developed a new manufacturing technique that significantly improves silica wires to be thinner, smoother, and stronger than current wires. With these improvements, the silica wires can help improve optic communication systems and, surprisingly, some textiles. In optical communication systems, thinner, smoother silica wires make thinner, smoother waveguides. The streamlined waveguides can more efficiently transmit light, reducing transmission losses in both long- and medium-distance systems. They could also be used in very short-distance systems, such as chip-to-chip or intra-chip communication, because they are so thin that they can operate at a sub-wavelength level. Waveguides need consistently sized and uniformly smooth silica wire to operate effectively. Dr. Mazur’s manufacturing technique can do just that: a two-step process produces uniform, lengthy, smooth, free-standing wires. As a result, making waveguides could become less expensive for the optic communications industry.The strength of the silica wires increased as well, they are now significantly stronger than wires of similar diameters. This strength extends their use to textiles where they could be used as spider silk to improve the strength of manufactured fabrics or lines.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Drs. Mazur, Gattass and Tong have developed a new method to manufacture silica wires that provide these significant overall improvements:  •     Size – The wire diameter is less than a light wavelength, down to 50 nanometers, and is uniform throughout the length of the wire. Most waveguides in use today have diameters that are greater than a wavelength.•     Smoothness – The surface is smooth at the atomic level. •     Strength – Wire tensile strength is 5 times as strong as spider silk (gossamer). With these properties, there could be a reduction in optical loss, in the visible to near-infrared ranges,  to levels less than 0.1 decibel per millimeter. As a result, any optical communication system that utilizes them will have improved operation efficiencies over existing silica wires."," Photonics/Optical Systems","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=2270","Alan Gordon, (617) 384-5000","Harvard University"

Increasingly, these techniques are being used to study biological processes as a function of time and/or chemical concentration.  Functionally-related processes may vary in timecourse or strength in different experiments or individuals.  Current clustering methods do not highlight their similarities, because while their expression- or reaction profiles may share structural features, they may be compressed or attenuated relative to each other in duration or amplitude.  Extracting maximal information from complex data arrays requires methods that can ""fit"" curves representing the different biological events (i.e., gene or protein expression/activity) by compensating for distortions caused by variations in rate or abundance.  Harvard Medical School researchers have developed dynamic software that is capable of addressing this important need.The software is superior to other available clustering techniques for anlyzing time and concentration data series, because it functions independent of differences in absolute rate or amount of change in the test parameter from one such series to another.  It is flexible, in that it corrects phase shifts between expression/reaction profiles and identifies functionally-related processes through time-independent comparison of expression/reaction profiles.

"CCMC   978","Licensable Technology","TIMP2 Loop 6 peptide: an endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor","Moses, Marsha","In many pathophysiological states, the growth of new blood vessels, or angiogenesis, is concomitant with disease progression.  For example, in arthritis, new capillary blood vessels invade the joint and destroy cartilage.  In cancer, unregulated angiogenesis, which serves to supply nutrients to cancer cells, is an essential factor in tumor growth and metastasis. In 'wet' macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy, ''neovascularization'' in the eye leads to an increased chance of blindness.  Effective treatment of these diseases will include new agents that inhibit angiogenesis. ||

Children's Hospital investigators have recently identified a novel, potent, small molecular weight inhibitor of angiogenesis.  The Moses laboratory has been investigating the mechanism of action of a family of endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors, the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs).   Through a series of structure-function studies, the investigators have demonstrated that the C-terminal end of TIMP2 is a potent inhibitor of both embryonic and mitogen-stimulated angiogenesis in vivo.   This activity maps to a 24 amino acid loop structure of TIMP2, referred to as Loop6.  Loop6 significantly inhibits both embryonic, unstimulated angiogenesis in vivo in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay, as well as mitogen-stimulated neovascularization in a second and more complex in vivo system, the mouse corneal pocket assay.  Interestingly, Loop 6 inhibits in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis at doses comparable to those of intact TIMP2.  Thus, the 24 amino acid loop6 of TIMP-2 is a novel angiogenesis inhibitor that is a promising new therapeutic for the treatment of diseases involving neovascularization."," Therapeutics - Drugs","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=978","Dietz, Ryan, ryan.dietz@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"

Because of their unique combination of high conductivity and optical transparence, tin compounds thin films are essential components of the new generations of smart flat panel displays, organic light emitting diodes (OLED), and gas sensors.The invention presented concerns novel precursors for the deposition of tin and lead, and tin and lead oxides, sulfides, nitrides, etc. on a variety of substrates using atomic layer deposition (ALD).  Most ALD processes require high growth temperatures (500°C) to operate properly.  The material presented here can be deposited at temperatures as low as 50°C with extremely high purity, smoothness, and uniformity.  The material properties can also be adjusted to give the deposited layer specific properties, including high conductivity, optical transparency, and semiconductor properties.    These attributes make this technology an excellent choice for a diverse range of applications.  The low temperature of deposition allows for the technology to be used on plastics and other thermally sensitive materials.  Therefore, this process can be used to coat LED/OLED devices, displays, and solar cells.  The range of material properties makes this method also desirable for microelectronics, photodetectors, gas sensors, electron multipliers, and piezo-electric devices.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:This invention offers novel materials comprising cyclic amides of tin and lead and new methods for depositing cyclic amides containing tin or lead on a variety of substrates using atomic layer deposition (ALD).   The combination of ALD and these materials allows for the creation of thin layers of tin or lead compounds with desirable properties.  For example, the deposition process yields extremely uniform and smooth coatings that can conform to holes or trenches in the substrate (good step coverage).  These materials can also be deposited with high purity and can be transparent and or highly electrically conductive, depending on the composition of the deposited material.  In addition to acting as a conductor, the material can also act as a semiconductor if doped with another material, such as aluminum.  One of the most significant advantages of these materials is that they can be deposited with ALD temperatures as low as 50°C.  This means that the cyclic amides can be deposited on thermally sensitive substrates such as plastic, allowing for conductive and transparent layers to applied on devices such as displays and solar cells."," Nanotechnology/NEMS  |   Electrical Engineering  |   Nanotechnology/NEMS  |   Electrical Engineering  |   Nanotechnology/NEMS","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3708","Mick Sawka, (617) 496-3830","Harvard University"

"172","Licensable Technology","Trans-Dominant Suppressor Genes for Oligomeric Proteins","Stiles, C","Platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), a potent mitogen, is a dimeric protein comprised of subunits linked by disulphide bonds. After translation, enzymes remove sequences from PDGF to yield an active form of the protein. Researchers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute have discovered that one can suppress the activity of PDGF through ""trans-dominant suppressor genes."" These genes encode modified protein subunits that combine with one of the wild-type subunits to form an inactive version of PDGF. In one example, a subunit was modified to resist the enzymatic processing step discussed above; in another case, a subunit was modified at the site of the disulphide bond. When either of these modified subunits dimerized with wild-type subunits, the resultant PDGF molecule was not bioactive. This demonstrates that the technology featured by this invention can be used to control PDGF activity.

Applications/Advantages: The PDGF mutants described above are capable of disrupting PDGF autocrine signaling loops. The PDGF autocrine signaling loops have been linked to a number of diseases (including lung carcinoma, malignant astrocytoma, glioma, sarcoma, coronary artery disease, cervical carcinoma, mammary carcinoma, atherosclerosis, and hyper-proliferative disorders of connective tissue such as rheumatoid arthritis). Further, this technology is not limited to PDGF, but to a whole family of oligomeric proteins which share similar enzymatic processing and structural features (i.e. disulphide bonds) with PDGF.

This problem applies to axonal mitochondria, which play the central role in the energy metabolism of axons and synapses despite their origination in the soma. Because mitochondria are typically sparsely distributed and large enough to be imaged with optical techniques, their means of distribution could be readily addressed by time-lapse imaging of mitochondria in vivo if a stable vital marker for neuronal mitochondria were available.This invention is a tool for the studies of mitochondrial transport in adult motor neurons. Results generated can be correlated to the complex geometry of nerve cells in situ, their physiological state, pathological changes and developmental dynamics.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Transgenic mice that express cyan fluorescent protein targeted to mitochondria. In these mice, neuronal mitochondria can be visualized in individual neurons including their dendrites, axons and synapses.

The invention is a small molecule probe for monitoring intracellular enzymatic activity such as activity of histone deacetylase (HDAC), an enzyme responsible for regulation of gene expression which has been associated with cancer, central nervous system disorders, heart disease, and inflammation. Properties of the probe are such that the probe selectively accumulates in cells where the target enzyme is located. The probe is modified upon interacting with the enzyme of interest, which increases cellular retention of the probe and therefore leads to accumulation of the probe within the cell. This probe is applicable to in vitro fluorescent detection of enzymes and to in vivo imaging modalities, including optical, MRI, and PET imaging.

Application:
The novel probe can be used to detect intracellular enzyme activity or HDAC activity using a one-step process which is applicable in vivo or to intact cells, and can be performed using optical, MRI, or PET imaging. The probe can also be used as a conjugate to deliver enzyme-targeted therapeutics.

Advantages:
- One-step process for fluorescent detection of enzyme/HDAC activity in intact cells.
- Probe can include fluorescent molecules, MRI contrast agents, or radioligands, allowing for in vitro or in vivo detection of HDAC/enzymes using multiple modalities.

"MCL 3180.0","Licensable Technology","Treatment and Diagnosis of Diseases Characterized by Mitochondrial Dysfunction","Anne Cataldo, Ph.D., et al.","Many heritable diseases are caused by mutations in mitochondrial genes or nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. In addition, environmentally-induced mutations in mitochondrial DNA have been implicated in many common acquired disorders.  Among the disorders involved in mitochondrial dysfunction are neuropsychiatric diseases such as bipolar disorder, depression, and schizophrenia; and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Friedreich's ataxia; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease. Treatment of such diseases has been attempted using transplanted tissues or cells, but such attempts can be complicated by the necessity of replacing diseased tissue rather than improving the function of existing cells and tissue. The present invention provides a therapeutic approach to overcoming mitochondrial dysfunction through mitochondrial replacement, without the replacement of existing cells. The viability of the method has been demonstrated in vitro, in experiments where mitochondria from adult stem cells were successfully transplanted into cells from bipolar disorder patients and were capable of normalizing the abnormal mitochondrial structure that is common in bipolar disorder. 
     Potential Commercial Uses: The invention features methods and kits for treatment of disorders associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, in which healthy mitochondria (e.g. from stem cells or other sources) are transplanted into diseased cells in the brain. The invention provides potentially powerful cell therapy strategies to treat brain disorders in situ without the replacement of existing cells, and offers the possibility that preparations of purified mitochondria could someday become an off-the-shelf product for therapeutic use. The invention also features methods of diagnosing neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders based on mitochondrial structural abnormalities.

In an effort to identify novel targets for the treatment of melanoma, Dr. Zon's lab has designed and performed a screen using a zebrafish model system of melanoma induced by the oncogenic BRAF-V600E mutation and deficiency for the p53 tumor suppressor, mutations which are commonly seen in human melanomas. Screening for genes capable of enhancing the generation of melanoma, the lab identified the SETDB1 gene, encoding a histone-lysine N-methyltransferase responsible for trimethylation of lysine 9 on histone H3, a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional repression. ||

Since the human SETDB1 gene is within a chromosomal region known to be amplified in human melanoma, this finding may provides a marker for melanoma diagnostics and a prognostic marker useful for identifying a subset of melanomas which have a more aggressive clinical course. Further, the studies indicate that overexpression of SETDB1 leads to more aggressive melanomas with enhanced local invasiveness.  This suggests that SETDB1 may be an attractive target for therapeutics in treating human melanoma and other malignancies with BRAF-V600E mutations or other Ras pathway overactivation."," Diagnostics/Prognostics  |   Research Reagents  |   Diagnostics/Prognostics","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=1779","Meyer, Abbie, abbie.meyer@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"

Recent studies reveal that this may be due to the illness' neuropathology rather than simply the patients' inability to afford healthier foods.  Schizophrenics appear to be particularly susceptible to the detrimental medical sequelae of obesity, including a host of cardiovascular risk factors.  The present invention capitalizes on recent discoveries concerning the reward and satiety pathways of psychiatric patients, and features  novel combinations of  specific antipsychotic medications with compounds of another drug type.  Such combinations may be useful in managing several physically degrading pathological conditions resulting from psychiatric disorders.
     Potential Commercial Uses: This invention comprises methods to treat weight gain and obesity associated with psychiatric disorders.  These novel combinations of drugs offer potentially advantageous ways to treat and manage these serious conditions that arise as a consequence of psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia, which are currently not amenable to conventional drug treatment.

The business opportunity now exists for companies developing NMDA receptor antagonists for other CNS indications to expand the market size for their compound by including indications related to stereotypic human behavior.Overview:Compulsive behaviors in humans have been defined by some researchers as acts that are repetitive and constant, which may appear to serve no obvious purpose, and may even be injurious. In studies conducted at Tufts University, NMDA antagonists demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of repetitive behavior in the following four animal models: cribbing in horses, stall-walking in horses, light/shadow chasing in dogs, and a mouse model for pruritus. Stereotypic behaviors of human and animals present similarities that that suggests a common etiology and the stereotypic behavior of humans has responded to treatment with some of the same drugs used to treat stereotypic behavior in animals. Therefore, the same underlying physiological processes appear to be involved in the causation of animal and human stereotypic behaviors and human stereotypic behavior should respond positively to this proposed new method of therapy with NMDA receptor antagonists.Applications:NMDA receptor antagonists would prove useful for the treatment of the following compulsive human behaviors: obsessive-compulsive disorder (with its various manifestations of checking, counting, washing to remove contamination, etc.), trichotillomania, psychogenic excoriation, nail biting compulsive exercising, smoking compulsion, drug (opioid) addiction, alcohol addiction, compulsive gambling, compulsive shopping, and eating disorders.Inventors:Louis Shuster, Professor of Pharmacology, Tufts University School of Medicine and Nicholas Dodman, Professor, Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine.Intellectual Property:Issued US patents: U.S. 6,242,456 and U.S. 6,500,838.

"CCMC   2277","Licensable Technology","Treatment of thrombosis and prevention of toxicity caused by neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)","Wagner, Denisa D.","During an infection, the body's innate immune system will be activated, bringing a number of non-specific defensive mechanisms (as opposed to the specific responses of the adaptive immune system such as antibodies) to bear on the threat. Neutrophils are one of the cell types involved in the innate immune response and they will engulf and then destroy pathogenic cells or damaged host cells. When activated neutrophils die, they release fibers of DNA associated with histones and antimicrobial proteins. These neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) serve to entangle and kill pathogens.||

Researchers in the lab of Denisa Wagner and collaborators have shown that NETs contribute to experimental deep vein thrombosis (DVT). NETs stimulate thrombus formation and coagulation and are abundant in thrombi in animal models of DVT. It appears that, in addition to fibrin and von Willebrand factor, NETs represent a third thrombus scaffold that need to be undone during thrombolysis. Prevention of NETs formation or their destruction by the enzyme DNase I drastically reduced the incidence of DVT.||

Recently, Dr. Wagner found, in collaboration with Thomas Wakefield's group at the University of Michigan, increased levels of DNA in plasma from patients with DVT compared with healthy controls and symptomatic patients who did not have DVT. Here also, plasma DNA concentrations correlated with D-dimers (unpublished data; Diaz and Fuchs, 2012). Therefore, it is plausible that circulating DNA may reflect presence of DVT in a patient as it reflects the degradation of NETs within a thrombus.||

This research shows that subjects treated with DNase or anti-histone antibodies may reduce the level of NETs and reduce the incidence and severity of deep vein thrombosis. NETs represent a good biomarker of thrombosis.||

Researchers in Dr. Wagner's lab have shown that NET biomarkers are present inÂ  transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)Â patients' blood and that NETs are produced in vitro by primed human neutrophils when challenged with anti-HNA-3a antibodies previously implicated inÂ TRALI. NETs are found in alveoli of mice experiencing antibody-mediatedÂ TRALI. DNase 1 inhalation prevents their alveolar accumulation and improves arterial oxygen saturation even when administered 90 minutes afterÂ TRALIÂ onset suggesting that that NETs form in the lungs duringÂ TRALI could be targeted to prevent or treatÂ TRALI."," Therapeutics - Methods  |   Therapeutics - Drugs","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=2277","Dietz, Ryan, ryan.dietz@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"

Movement of cells is modulated by chemoattractants and chemorepellents. Excessive cell migration may be harmful, as in autoimmune diseases and transplant rejections; while insufficient migration of immune cells or a weak immune reaction to cancerous cells or infections may lead to disease. The local application of fugetactic agents such as the chemokine SDF-1a can be a useful therapeutic strategy to manipulate cell migration. 

Applications:
A) Repelling immune cells by local administration of fugetactic agents in combination with anti-inflammatory drugs to sites of a transplant, implant, infection, atherosclerosis or a local autoimmune process. Amenable diseases include rheumatoid arthritis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and Crohn's disease.
B) Inhibiting tumor cell metastasis or endothelial cell migration to a tumor site by local application of anti-fugetactic agents, alone or in combination with anti-cancer or anti-infectious agents. This leads to site-specific enhancement of immune responses immediately surrounding a tumor, or at infection sites. 
C) Fugetactic agents include chemokine SDF-1a, envelope glycoprotein HIV-1IIIB gp120 and small molecule agents, such as T134, MD3010 and T22. 
D) Anti-fugetactic agents include peptides and antibodies which bind selectively to fugetaxins and inhibit their activity, eg. cytokine-binding agents like AMD3100.

Advantages:
- Local use of fugetactic agents, as an alternative to systemic immunosuppression
- Avoids side-effects, such as opportunistic infections and transplant-associated malignancies.

These NETs entangle and may kill pathogens, possibly impeding bacterial infection.||
 
While NETs formation can serve a healthy purpose, Denisa Wagner shows that they also promote the development of blood clots in deep vein thrombosis, cancer, lung injury, and potentially impair wound healing in diabetes. Additional studies are underway to determine how NET formation might be pharmacologically impaired to prevent these dangerous medical conditions.||
 
Targeting NETs to Prevent Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)|
Dr. Wagner shows that plasma DNA levels are increased in patients with DVT indicating the presence of DVT in a patient, as it reflects the degradation of NETs within a thrombus. To demonstrate that blocking NET formation reduces DVT, Dr. Wagner’s lab pioneered the use of PAD4 knockout mice for DVT studies, since PAD4 is required for NETs formation. Her data show that wild type mice produce thrombi 90% of the time, in contrast to PAD4 knockout mice which produced thrombi less than 10% of the time. This suggests PAD4 inhibition may be an effective approach in preventing or treating DVT.||
 
Studies of NETs and Blood Clots in Cancer|
Dr. Wagner’s lab shows that NETs play a critical role in blood clot formation in cancer. In a mouse model of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), both malignant and healthy neutrophils were found to be more prone to generating extracellular DNA traps. Increased NETs formation is also observed in other animal models of solid tumors including breast and lung cancer xenografts. Further, Dr. Wagner’s lab shows that G-CSF boosts neutrophil abundance and promotes NET production supporting previous reports that cancer patients with high G-CSF levels are predisposed to a pro-thrombotic state. ||
 
Studies of NETs in Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)|
Dr. Wagner’s lab showed that NET biomarkers are present in the blood of patients with lung injury due to TRALI. In vitro studies show that neutrophils produce NETs following exposure to anti-HNA-3a antibodies, which are implicated in TRALI. In addition, her lab demonstrated NETs prevention in TRALI mouse models when treated with DNase I, suggesting that NET formation in the lungs can be targeted to treat TRALI or other inflammatory lung conditions.||
 
Studies of NETs and Impaired Wound Healing in Diabetes|
Dr. Wagner showed that NETs are induced by diabetes and can impair wound healing in diabetes patients. Diabetic subjected to excisional skin wounds displayed abundant citrullinated histone H3, a marker of NETs, and the presence of this protein was associated with delayed healing. DNase1 treatment cleared NETs and accelerated healing these diabetic mice suggesting that inhibition or cleavage of NETs may provide an effective means of improving wound healing in diabetic patients."," Therapeutics - Drugs  |   Diagnostics/Prognostics  |   Research Reagents","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=2709","Dietz, Ryan, ryan.dietz@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"

Ablation of these exons renders the ion channel non-functional.  In addition to generating the mutation, a human placental alkaline phosphatase (hPLAP) marker was placed under the Trpa1 promoter.  The hPLAP marker allows identification of cells that express Trpa1.  For studies in pain research, C57Bl/6J mice are used as the standard genetic background.  In order for the Trpa1 animals to be used for pain research, the Trpa1 constituitive knockout animals were backcrossed to the C57Bl/6J lines for over 10 generations resulting in a Trpa1 knockout animal that is essentially in the C57Bl/6J genetic background.

If such proteins fail to fold correctly and are not degraded by the proteasome, they can form aggregates in cells. These aggregates are transported via the microtubules using the dynein/dynactin motor complex. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is a class II HDAC protein that deacetylates alpha-tubulin and associates with dynein to facilitate transport of aggresomes through the cytosol to the proteasome for degradation.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Stuart Schreiber’s laboratory at the Broad Institute isolated a small molecule inhibitor of HDAC6 in a chemical genetic screen of 7392 small molecules and cell-based assay. This inhibitor, known as tubacin, inhibits ?-tubulin deacetylation in mammalian cells. Unlike trichostatin A (TSA), which is a broad spectrum HDAC inhibitor, tubacin is specific for the tubulin deacetylase activity of HDAC6. Tubacin inhibits HDAC6 and causes increased acetylation of ?-tubulin, accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins, and apoptosis. Tubacin does not affect global histone deacetylation, gene-expression profiling, or cell cycle progressionThe effects of tubacin have been studied in cell-based cancer models including hematologic malignancies, such as multiple myeloma and leukemia, and also solid tumor models, such as pancreatic cancer and ovarian cancer. Tubacin in combination with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade) resulted in increased ?-tubulin acetylation and accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins in multiple myeloma cells. Tubacin was also found to inhibit interaction of HDAC6 with dynein and augmented activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and caspase-3, -8 and -9. Both bortezomib and tubacin together induced synergistic antitumor activity in multiple myeloma cells and primary bone marrow plasma cells. Useful as a tool in many research areas such as cancer, apoptosis, HDAC activity, aggresome and ubiquitin pathways, etc., tubacin is available for non-exclusive license in research-use.Niltubacin, an inactive derivative of tubacin, can be used as a negative control compound and is also available for non-exclusive license in research-use."," Chemistry","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=1917","Rene Castro, (617) 495-3663","Harvard University"

Dr. Rocco and Dr. Mroz at MGHs Division of Surgical Oncology have developed the Mutant Allele Tumor Heterogeneity (MATH) algorithm that can use sequencing data from tumor to quantify an intra-tumor heterogeneity value.  A tumor with high Intra-tumor heterogeneity, is more likely to evade therapy, leading to treatment failure or relapse.  The ability to measure intra-tumor heterogeneity would provide prognostic information that allows physicians to find a suitable treatment for the patient and improve their outcomes.

The inventors have demonstrated a correlation between a high MATH value and poor outcome classes in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), using published sequencing results on 74 individual HNSCC samples.  The inventors have obtained proof of concept, showing that the MATH value could be used to predict worse clinical outcomes in HNSCC, with a better correlation than that of human papillomavirus (HPV) and TP53 tumor suppressor status - two well-known biomarkers of poor-outcome in HNSCC.

Applications: 
-	A tool for assessing the level of tumor heterogeneity through the examination of mutations in tumor DNA sequence
-	A clinical decision-making tool for examining the effect of therapy on tumors, e.g. assessing tumor-heterogeneity pre- and post- therapy
-	Diagnostics for personalized medicine, e.g. as a tool for stratifying the patient population during clinical trials and targeted drug development

Advantages:  
-	May be used to assess intra-tumor heterogeneity for all types of tumors, not just head and neck cancer
-	No need to analyze specific tumor markers or gene mutations per patient, unlike molecular diagnostics
-	Provides analysis of intra-tumor heterogeneity at a higher detail than available technologies, via unbiased examination of tumor DNA sequence

Due to the severity of some of its complications, early detection of diabetes is critical. The majority of patients with diabetes have Type 2 diabetes, the non-insulin dependent form. The invention is based on the discovery of a gene correlated with susceptibility to Type 2 diabetes, located within a previously identified 10-cM locus (Klupa, et al. (2000) Diabetes 49:2212-2216). Preliminary analysis of recombination events within families most strongly linked at this locus has allowed the narrowing of the critical region to an interval less than 1MB in length. Through genomic analysis, six known genes and several new genes were mapped to this region, at least one of which is believed to be a true transcript. The invention comprises the sequence of a novel diabetes susceptibility gene and its gene product, as well as numerous polymorphisms in this gene that correlate with the incidence of diabetes in patients. The invention can therefore be used in diagnostic tests to detect a genetic susceptibility to Type 2 diabetes.

"1690","Licensable Technology","Ultra fast method for chiral catalyst discovery","Shair, Matthew D.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:While combinatorial chemistry has been successfully applied to the problem of chiral catalyst discovery, its utility is severely hampered by the lack of rapid, high-throughput screens for enantiomeric purity. Current methods require weeks to screen the products of 10,000 reactions.  As a consequence, chemical companies face an increasing need for high throughput methods capable of efficiently producing enantiomerically pure products.According to a study by the market research firm Frost and Platt, the worldwide market for chiral fine chemicals sold as single enantiomers is expected to grow at a rate of 13.2% annually; sales were up from $6.63 billion in 2000 to $16 billion in 2007.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:This invention is a novel method for determining--in less than 24 hours--enantiomeric ratios, percent conversions, and absolute configurations of all members of a chemical library containing at least 10,000 reaction products. Reaction mixtures are immobilized on a surface and then combined with fluorescent identification reagents that react at different rates with products of different chirality. Reaction products are analyzed simply by measuring their fluorescence.Reaction microarrays allow researchers to identify products with high enantiomeric excess from libraries of thousands of reaction mixtures in hours rather than weeks. About 0.02 nmoles of product from each reaction is arrayed and immobilized on a 1x3-inch glass slide. A large excess of identification reagent can be used to drive the reaction to completion, and the chip can be easily rinsed clean. Because of the small amounts of product immobilized on the chip surface, 100 equivalents of identification reagent amounts to only about 0.3 mg for a 10,800-reaction slide, minimizing the costs of analysis. Since reaction microarrays are used to analyze reaction products, they are amenable to standard catalysis discovery methods that involve the variation of ligand structure, reaction conditions, and additives, as well as to combinatorial discovery methods. Furthermore, reaction microarrays employ the same instrumentation as DNA microarrays, and therefore benefit from the constant improvements made in robotic arraying, contact printing, and laser scanning."," Chemical Methods/Libraries  |   Drug Discovery Tools  |   Chemical Methods/Libraries","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=1690","Vivian Berlin, (617) 496-0474","Harvard University"
"2006-0501","Licensable Technology","Ultra high-resolution protein fingerprinting of biopsy samples by mass spectrometry","Agar, Jeffrey; Agar, Nathalie","• The Situation: The current resolution of MALDI mass spectral imaging is inadequate for comprehensive protein profiling of small tissue or cellular samples. Sample preparation takes hours and expensive instrument is required. Moreover, results are not reproducible due to poor sample preparation methods.

• Our Solution: We have developed a novel MALDI sample preparation method that enables high-resolution protein profiling up to 1-micron level. The technology increases spatial resolution by fifty times, while reduces sample preparation time and costs by a hundred times over existing processes. Our invention allows rapid and accurate fingerprinting of a biopsy sample, therefore will revolutionize disease diagnosis in the future.

Background:
Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization (MALDI) is an ionization technique often used for mass spectrometric analysis of large biomolecules, such as proteins. Direct mass spectrometry analysis of a tissue sample affords a wealth of chemical information, providing a molecular landscape of a tissue. Mass spectrometry imaging provides spatial and chemical information on hundreds of molecules at a time, providing a better correlation between molecular composition and disease pathology, and therefore a more accurate diagnosis. However, current resolution of MALDI mass spectral imaging is in the range of 1 mm, much too low for comprehensive protein profiling of small tissue or cellular samples.

Applications:
This invention is a unique tissue preparation method for MALDI mass spectrometry which allows the generation of ultra-high resolution 2-D protein profile of biopsy samples and provides a cost-effective means for accurate early diagnosis of diseases.

Advantages:
• 5-minute sample preparation time for ultra high-resolution Mass Spectrometer analysis.
• Low running costs: working prototype costs only $6 per sample.
• By incorporating with existing MALDI mass spectrometry instrumentation and statistics method, this technology will prompt rapid and accurate diagnosis of a wide range of diseases as well as leads for new drugs to combat them.
• Through existing medical partnerships with Harvard Medical School, we are building a comprehensive disease fingerprint database by comparing patient biopsy samples with normal tissue samples. Such database will be invaluable for developing early-stage diagnostics and therapeutics for cancer, neural degenerative diseases, and infectious diseases.

Technology:
We developed a method for the preparation of frozen tissue sections for use in MALDI mass spectrometry imaging, and this is the first such process that is compatible with existing histology procedures routinely employed by pathologists for diagnosing diseases. In this process, a matrix, which is usually a small acid that crystallizes on the surface of a tissue sample, is incorporated directly into the tissue during the tissue fixation process. This new concept method prevents proteins from moving or diffusing from their original location, therefore allowing high-resolution mass spectrometry images to be produced.

Healthcare information technologyInvention SummaryBackground:Biological implants, RFID tags, smart credit cards and other applications of lower bit-rate communications require low power transceiver architectures. In case of biological implants, external data transmitters also serve a dual purpose of wireless delivery of power to the implant, also called power telemetry. In such applications, BPSK has advantages over Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) and Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) as a more suitable protocol of communication. BPSK gains its advantages by having fixed signal amplitude and a constant carrier frequency that provide a data independent stable power transfer and high power transfer efficiency by using fixed size antennas. BPSK is also a robust technique for data communications in low bit rate communication as in the case of biological implants.Invention:Tufts researchers have developed a novel Charge Pump PLL based low power BPSK demodulator. The design features low power consumption, simple architecture, high data rate and reliable performance. This architecture has been verified by Cadence simulation and chip measurement. Applying more advanced CMOS technology and optimizing the circuit design can further reduce the power consumption. The proposed architecture gives a very power efficient BPSK demodulator suitable for biomedical implants."," Medical Devices","http://www.tufts.biz/cgi-bin/tech_search.cgi?r=1&case=T001440","Martin Son617-636-3605martin.son@tufts.edu","Tufts University"

"3733","Licensable Technology","Uniform phage display amplification in droplets","Whitesides, George M.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:The display of random foreign peptide sequences on the coat proteins of bacteriophages (""phage display"") is a widely-used research and drug discovery technique for creating and screening highly diverse peptide libraries for peptide sequences that bind usefully to targets. The technique involves rounds of selection (exposure of the phage library to a target) and amplification (pooled replication of target-binding phage clones in host bacteria). However, since different phage clones may have different replication rates when competing for the same pool of bacteria, the amplification stage tends to favor the selection of the fastest replicating clones at the expense of slower-replicating, but potentially valuable, ones. Elimination of undesired competition between different phage clones during amplification would enable selection of a wider repertoire of target-binding phage. Researchers in the laboratory of George Whitesides have developed a non-competitive phage display amplification method that eliminates the influence of the relative rates of replication of different phage clones. This method should expand the repertoire of ligands that can be identified using a wide variety of in vitro selection procedures.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:A microfluidic flow-focusing droplet generator is used to separate individual phage clones from a mixture of both slowly growing (S) and rapidly growing (R) phage into monodisperse droplets of growth media (ca. 200 mm in diameter) containing host bacteria, suspended in a surfactant carrier fluid that prevents the individual droplets from coalescing when collected. At sufficiently low concentrations of phage, each droplet contains one or no phage particles and about 100 bacteria. The droplets in surfactant are collected in a standard Petri dish and rocked at 36 degrees Celsius. By isolating different phage in different droplets, the relative number of S and R clones present at the start is preserved after amplification. Because amplification of phage clones depends on the size of the droplets in which they reside, the use of droplets of uniform size is essential for the success of this process.Uniform Aplification of Phage: a) Isolation of phage in separate droplets that contained bacteria eliminates competition during amplification. b) Images of droplets generated in a flow-focusing microfluidic droplet generator. c) Images of bacteria (arrow heads) and dividing bacteria (arrow) in a droplet. d) R/S ratio obtained by amplification of a 1:1 mixture of R and S phage in bulk solution or in droplets. The number of phage obtained by amplification of phage at different initial concentrations is compared. e) The final concentrations of R and S were proportional to the initial numbers of R and S phage. This strategy of preserving the ratio between mixtures of different clones by isolating them from each other in individual compartments of identical size is applicable to any in vitro selection/amplification process where preferential amplification of library members is a problem (e.g., phage-, ribosome-, RNA-, and DNA-display, aptamers). Laboratories currently without microfluidic capabilities should find it relatively straightforward to incorporate this fairly simple method into the amplification stage of their procedures."," Drug Discovery Tools  |   Drug Discovery Tools  |   Drug Discovery Tools","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3733","Mick Sawka, (617) 496-3830","Harvard University"

Other molecules such as adhesion and accessory molecules facilitate binding of T cells to APCs. This technology provides modified APCs, which are engineered to express a selected antigen to generate or enhance an immune response; the modified APCs may also be engineered to express MHC class I or II, any combination of accessory and adhesion molecules, and cytokines. Fluorescent reporter proteins may be fused to the antigens to select and purify APCs expressing the antigen-encoding nucleic acid.

Applications/Advantages: The present invention overcomes traditional problems associated with immunoregulatory approaches. This more efficient and specific method allows one to reduce the antigen dose provided in a vaccine, and promises a more specific and consistent response with avoidance of the unwanted side effects caused by conventional antigen-presenting methods. Correspondingly, modified APCs show promise in the clinic, and can be used in the treatment of a variety of diseases including microbe infections, cancers (including cervical, breast, colorectal, prostate, lung cancers, and melanomas) and pathologies associated with transplantation.

Three Akt isoforms (Akt1, Akt2 and Akt3) have been identified and numerous chemical inhibitors of this cascade are currently in development. Usually methods of Akt inhibition are based on regulation of total Akt signaling activity; consequently particular Akt inhibitors may significantly differ in their ability to target specific Akt isoforms. Dr. Philip Tsichlis of Tufts Medical Center and his collaborators have demonstrated that Akt1, Akt2 and Akt3 differ in their ability to transduce oncogenic signals and have both positive and negative effect on the development and progression of human cancers. These Tufts Medical Center researchers have further demonstrated that some processes, such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition -a characteristic feature of invasive cancers, are controlled by the ratio between Akt1 and Akt2 rather than by the overall activity of Akt pathway. Therefore, it’s critical for the development of safe and effective Akt inhibitors for the treatment of cancer that a particular Akt inhibitor strikes the right balance in its activity against different Akt isoforms which in turn requires a method to measure its effect on the Akt1/Akt2 ratio. Tufts Medical Center researchers have now developed such a method utilizing a panel of miRNAs differentially regulated by Akt1 and Akt2.Background:While the specific contribution of each of Akt isoform to oncogenesis is still being fully elucidated, Dr. Philip Tsichlis and his collaborators have used elegant in vitro and in vivo models to demonstrate that each Akt isoform has a different contribution to cancer initiation and progression. Downregulation of Akt2 in mouse mammary adenocarcinomas induced by transgenes encoding oncoprotein facilitates tumor formation, while ablation of Akt1 results in inhibition of tumor induction and growth. Interestingly, Akt1 deficiency promotes cell migration and epithelial mesenchymal transition accompanied by decrease in the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin and upregulation of the expression of mesenchymal cell-specific protein Vimentin in mammary epithelial cells in vitro. In in vivo models, tumors, developing in Akt1-deficient mice, are more aggressive than in Akt2-deficient or wild-type mice. This data suggest that Akt1 deficiency inhibits growth of primary tumors but tumors appearing after the relapse may be much more invasive and aggressiveInvention summary:Current invention provides a newly identified and specific miRNA panel that can be used to measure the Akt1/Akt2 isoform ratio, which information can be used to (i) modulate clinical treatment and (ii) develop better Akt inhibitors in the drug development process. The Akt1/Akt2 isoform ratio represents a surrogate method to discriminate between then beneficial and detrimental effects of isoform-specific Akt inhibition on tumor growth and metastasis. Using in vitro cell system and miRNA profiling, Tufts Medical Center scientists demonstrated that certain members of miR-200 family of miRNAs (e.g. miRNA-200a, -200b, -200c) targeting transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin Zeb1 and Zeb2, among others, are differentially regulated by Akt1 and Akt2 isoform activity. In particular, inhibition of Akt1, while leaving Act2 intact, results in (i) downregulation of miRNA-200a, -200b, -200c expression; (ii) decrease in the level of E-cadherin expression both on Mrna and protein level; (iii) facilitation of cell migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition often associated with aggressive cancer phenotype and tumor invasiveness; and (iv) decrease in the sensitivity of tumor cells to hypoxia, making them more resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Conversely, overexpression of members of miRNA-200 family reverses the effects caused by Akt1 inhibition. This process is controlled by changes in Akt1/Akt2 ratio, rather than the total level of Akt signaling, since downregulation of both Akt1 and Akt2 isoforms attenuates the effect of Akt1 downregulation on Zeb1, Zeb2 and E-cadherin expression and cell migration. The important role of the Akt1/Akt2 isoform ratio in tumor progression was confirmed in mouse model of mammary adenocarcinomas: tumors arising in Akt1-deficient mice have low abundance of microRNAs of miR-200 family, are more aggressive, and have a greater metastatic potential than their Akt1-positive counterparts. Analysis of primary and metastatic human mammary adenocarcinoma clinical samples further confirmed that metastasis is associated with a decrease in the Akt1/Akt2 isoform ratio and downregulation of expression of miR-200 family of RNAs.Applications:This miRNA panel consisting of miRNA-200a, -200b, -200c provides a convenient method to analyze Akt1/Akt2 isoform ratio that can be used for the following applications:1. Preclinical validation of new Akt inhibitors and optimization of current Akt-targeting therapies. The evidence demonstrates that safer and more efficacious Akt inhibitors will be the compounds that have the desired target specificity toward the Akt1 and Akt2 isoforms, resulting in a safe Akt1/Akt2 isoform ratio. The present miRNA-200a, -200b, -200c screening panel provides exactly such a method to determine whether a particular Akt inhibitor results in a safe Akt1/Akt2 isoform ratio.2. Diagnostic tool for analysis of biological parameters of tumors such as metastatic potential and invasiveness The analysis of Akt1/Akt2 isoform ratio in patients, as measured by the difference in the expression of members of miR-200 family compared to normal control, can help physicians to analyze the metastatic potential of an existing tumor and assist to design an effective treatment protocol.Inventors:Lead inventor is Dr. Philip Tsichlis of Tufts Medical Center.

The business opportunity now exists to exploit this scientific discovery to develop improved topical treatments that would promote wound healing in skin and other epithelial tissues. NOTE: Field-limited license only is available. Use of galectin-3 and -7 for the treatment of corneal wounds is licensed.Overview:Galectin-3 and Galectin-7 are carbohydrate-binding proteins of the galectin family that have been shown to promote corneal epithelial sheet migration, a key event in corneal epithelial wound healing. The extent of acceleration of re-epithelialization of wounds with both galectin-3 and galectin-7 was greater than that observed in most of the published studies using growth factors. Also, epithelium of corneas treated with growth factors such as EGF is hyperplastic , a clearly undesirable condition.  In this respect, the clinical potential of galectin-3 and galectin-7 may be more attractive than that of growth factors because the lectins have not been shown to induce cell mitosis in epithelial cells. Ongoing work intends to delineate the mechanism by which galectin-3 and -7 mediate corneal epithelial sheet migration and wound closure and the specific signal transduction pathways which may be modulated by galectins.Applications:Galectin-based treatments will have clinical applications in the promotion of the healing of wounds associated with any epithelial tissue, for example the skin epithelium, the corneal epithelium, the lining of the gastrointenstinal tract, the lung epithelium, post-transplantation wounds, chronic wounds in the elderly, decubitus ulcers, and venous stasis ulcers of the skin.  At present, treatment of persistent epithelial defects of the cornea is a major clinical problem. In some cases, following accidental injury to the cornea and various surgical procedures (e.g. PRK for correction of myopia) there is a delay in epithelial healing which places the cornea at risk of developing postoperative haze, infectious keratitis and ulceration.

Obesity is a common, serious and growing problem. The prevalence of this disorder has markedly increased since the mid-1980s. In the United States, 50% of adults are overweight and 30% are obese.  Consequently, developing obesity treatments that target novel pathways is a growing focus for both biopharmaceutical and the medical device industries. It has been shown that mast cells are a major component of fat tissue and mast cells play an important role in the development of obesity by making and releasing of pro-inflammatory cytokines, histamines and other mediators. Inventors have shown that administration of mast cell stabilizing drugs (e.g. Cromolyn) is an effective method to prevent and reduce obesity in mouse models.

Application:  
A drug that stabilizes mast cell can be used to control obesity.

Advantages: 
Current drug based approaches to treat obesity target appetite control or inhibition of fat uptake.  However, drugs in both of these classes have serious side effects.  There is a clear unmet need for identifying drugs to treat obesity with minimal and acceptable side effects.  Mast cell stabilizers are currently on the market to prevent or control certain allergic disorders.  Therefore, drugs targeting mast cell stabilization is a novel way to treat obesity with minimal or no side effects."," Therapeutic","http://www.partners.org/techtransfer/availabletechnologies/default.asp","Yogesh Sharma, ysharma@partners.org, 617-954-9382","Brigham and Women's Hospital"

The dual role of ANG in prostate cancer progression suggests that ANG translocation is a molecular target for the development of cancer drugs.  Inhibitors of ANG nuclear translocation would combine the benefits of both anti-angiogenesis and chemotherapy, due to the fact that both angiogenesis and cell proliferation are mediated, at least in part, by ANG activity.  It is thought that targeting ANG translocation would be more efficacious than targeting ANG directly because of the high plasma concentration of ANG in the plasma.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Mechanistic studies have shown that ANG undergoes nuclear translocation in both endothelial and cancer cells where it up-regulates ribosomal RNA transcription, stimulating cell proliferation.

The optic nerve represents a classic paradigm of regenerative failure in the CNS. Inflammation can have both positive and negative effects in the CNS after injury.  Dr. Benowitz's lab discovered that if macrophages and neutrophils are activated in the eye, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) switch into an active growth state following injury and regenerate lengthy axons into the distal optic nerve.||

Dr. Benowitz's lab identified a small Ca2+-binding protein, oncomodulin (Ocm), as a potent macrophage-derived growth factor that stimulates regeneration of injured axons in the optic nerve, a brain pathway in which regeneration does not normally occur. The lab showed that Ocm is expressed in the CNS as well as in macrophages and neutrophils (which are part of the body's innate immune system), binds directly to RGCs, and in low nanomolar concentrations, stimulates greater axon outgrowth from RGCs than other known trophic factors. Most significantly, Ocm promotes optic nerve regeneration in vivo, making it potentially useful therapeutically. Additionally, it is believed that the cAMP modulator and axogenic factor potentiates the activity of Ocm. Therefore if a cAMP modulator is further administered contemporaneously to the subject, an increase in the amount of regeneration may result.||

Dr. Benowitz proposes the use Ocm or a combination of Ocm and cAMP analog to improve regeneration in the peripheral nervous system and the spinal cord. This is based on the discovery that when Ocm is applied to peripheral neurons in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), the ability of these cells to grow axons when placed in culture a week later is greatly augmented. This result was published in Nature Neuroscience in 2006. ||

Ocm is also potentiated by PTEN deletion (Kurimoto et al, J.

Stepwise protocol is being explored to differentiate hESCs into functional beta cells. An essential step is the generation of pancreatic progenitors -- cells that express Pdx1 and produce all the cell types of the pancreas. As an alternative to using coculture with other cell types and growth factors as inducers, the laboratory of Douglas Melton uses cell-permeable small molecules as a means to control in vitro differentiation of hESCs. Small-molecule inducers would be less expensive, more easily controlled and possibly more efficient than growth factors in directing differentiation. The Melton's group has identified that (-)-indolactam V (ILV) activates PKC signaling and directs the pancreatic specification of hESCs that have already been committed to the endoderm lineage.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:•     ILV can be used alone, or in combination with growth factors, to direct differentiation of ESCs into pancreatic specification. ILV is effective on human ESC lines and mouse ESC lines. •     ILV is effective on human ESC lines HUES 2, 4 and 8. After 4 days treatment with ILV alone, 27% of HUES 8–derived cells were positively stained by Pdx1 antibody.•     In mouse ESCs that had been induced to form definitive endoderm (DE), after treatment with 300 nM ILV, the percentage of Pdx1-expressing cells increased from 4% to 50%.•     Titration of ILV from 20 nM to 5 mM showed that it functions in a dose-dependent manner. Effector concentration for half-maximum response (EC50) = 142 nM; with the highest efficacy and no detectable toxicity at 300 nM.•     ILV acts synergistically with FGF10, a growth factor involves in pancreatic development.

"2137","Licensable Technology","Using electro-magnetically induced transparency in photonic crystal cavities to obtain huge non-linear effects","Hau, Lene V.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:In the early 1980's, the prospect of all-optical computers was a hot area of research. Such computers could conceivably operate at much higher clock speeds, and would need much more amenable to high-degree parallelization than electronic computers. Unfortunately, the power requirements needed to obtain large enough non-linearities to realize this scheme with the solutions that existed at the time were many orders of magnitude too large for all-optical computing to be feasible. If better non-linear materials were available and the needed power could therefore be reduced, all-optical computing would become a very interesting prospect again.In the nodes of any long-haul telecommunication network, one needs to perform electro-optical conversion and ultra fast electronics in order to process optical signals. There are physical limitations that prevent electronics from functioning well at very high frequencies, including power, which makes such electronic devices extremely expensive. In fact, almost 90% of the cost of any long-haul network lies in modules that perform electro-optical conversion. Consequently, there is a rapidly growing need and interest in developing satisfactory all-optical signal processing. Another important application where very large optical non-linearities could play a crucial role is the emerging field of quantum information and quantum computation. Due to their minimal interactions with environment and low absorption losses in many media, photons are the preferred long-distance carriers of quantum information. At various nodes of such a quantum-information network, the information will need to be processed. Although quantum information can be transferred from one system to another e.g. photons to electrons, and then back, such transfers are technologically challenging. Consequently, there is a need to perform all-optic quantum-information processing. To achieve this, one has to have non-linear effects large enough to be triggered by single photon power levels. More generally, because of their low decoherence rates, photons might very well also turn out to be the preferred way of implementing quantum computation. In that case, the currently non-existing capability to influence the quantum state of a single photon with a single other photon will become even more important.Applicable markets include:-Telecommunications-Quantum information processing-All-optical computingINNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:This invention describes a photonic crystal system which uses electro-magnetically induced transparency (EIT) as the non-linear medium in photonic crystal cavities to obtain devices of unprecedent non-linear sensitivity, with operating power requirements many orders of magnitude smaller than in most non-linear optics devices. Implementation is not limited to EIT and can use any kind of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED).This invention also describes a method of forming a microcavity structure inside of a photonic crystal, which is doped with materials that exhibit electro-magnetic induced transparency so as to increase the non-linear properties of the photonic crystals."," Photonics/Optical Systems","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=2137","Mick Sawka, (617) 496-3830","Harvard University"

Dr. Dowling’s genetically modified Zebrafish provides eye disease researchers with several scientific advantages over previous generations.  It has a single, modified, stable gene exclusively in their rod photoreceptors. Unlike previous studies with Zebrafish, which passed on the modified gene at very low rates, this gene remains the same throughout multiple generations of the fish, can be detected in larvae and living fish, and can be seen in frozen sections using microscopy without antibody staining. With this genetic stability and visibility, researchers can more readily study specific genetic mutations, assess the impact that chemicals or drugs have on the photoreceptors, study the visual system development, and better understand the degeneration process."," Drug Discovery Tools  |   Therapeutics - Methods  |   Biomaterials  |   Research Reagents  |   Drug Discovery Tools  |   Research Reagents","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=2212","Debra Peattie, (617) 495-3067","Harvard University"

Applications are well suited for semiconductor manufacturing.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:This invention is a better method.

MSCs secrete a broad spectrum of bioactive molecules, including trophic factors, anti-apoptotic molecules, angiogenic factors and immunomodulators, which help create regenerative microenvironments localized to sites of tissue injury.  Therefore, MSCs may be an important therapeutic tool for the replacement or repair of damaged tissues such as bone, cartilage, or tendon.  The most common source of MSCs is the bone marrow, however, aspirating bone marrow from patients is an invasive, low-yield procedure.  In addition, the number and differentiating potential of bone marrow MSCs decreases with age.  Therefore, the search for alternative sources of MSCs is of significant value.Researchers in Dr. Olsen’s laboratory developed a novel method by which mature vascular endothelial cells can be induced to trans-differentiate into MSC-like cells.  Since vascular endothelial cells can easily be obtained in large numbers (for example, from umbilical cord blood), these methods have a significant advantage over isolating MSCs from bone marrow.  The lab demonstrated that treatment of vascular endothelial cells with certain factors activates a receptor which decreases the expression of endothelial markers such as VE-cadherin.  Furthermore, the induced MSC-like cells demonstrate multipotency.  When cultured in lineage specific culture medium, the endothelial derived cells express lineage-specific transcription factors and target genes for chondrocytes, osteoblasts or adipocytes."," Chemical Methods/Libraries","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3602","Grant Zimmermann, (617) 495-3067","Harvard University"

"3211","Licensable Technology","Vertical silicon nanowires as a universal platform for highly efficient delivery of bioactive molecules into living cells","Park, Hongkun","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Existing strategies for delivering exogenous materials into cells (e.g., viral vectors, physio-chemical means, or microinjection) are limited either by the range of chemical and biological species that each can deliver, or by the efficiency or throughput of the delivery. While there have been previous efforts to use nanostructured materials to introduce bioactive species into cells, they too have been inefficient and generally limited to the delivery of genetic material.  The potential to deliver a wide range of molecules at sites of one’s choosing lends itself to a broad variety of implementations and applications, including the following:1. Massive, parallel screening for drug discovery: the cellular effects of many proteins (proteomics), siRNAs (knockdown efficacy), and small molecules (drug/antibiotic resistance) may be assayed simultaneously, either singly or in combinations; by perturbing different elements of a particular cellular pathway, the causal relationships between those elements can be discovered.2. Cell-based ADME/Tox assays: the concentration-dependent effects of a particular protein, drug, and/or combinations can be studied in cell-based assays.3. Derivation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells: the platform is suitable for efficiently delivering (and discovering) molecules capable of reprogramming adult cells into iPS cells. 4. Designer cell networks and disease models: the platform can be used to construct complex cellular systems, such as synaptic pairs of differentially perturbed neurons for modeling neurodegenerative diseases. 5. Assays of epigenetic factors: the platform could be used to discover molecules that usefully affect the differentiation and development of any set of cells (e.g., stem cells, iPS cells, or differentiated tissues), and then further used to generate cells of a particular lineage for use in cell-based therapies.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:This platform consists of an array of surface-modified vertical silicon nanowires that have been chemically grown or etched on a wafer and to which virtually any kind of bioactive species (drug, protein, nucleic acid, nanoparticles) may be attached by covalent or electrostatic means. When cells are plated on the surface of the array, they are penetrated by the functionalized nanowires, and the bioactive material is thus efficiently delivered into the cytosol of the cells. Since the cells remain viable after penetration, the effects of the delivered material on the cells can be monitored over time. By optimizing the cell-nanowire interface through the use of novel surface chemistry and the precise control over nanowire density, diameter, and height, investigators in the laboratory of Professor Hongkun Park at Harvard University have created a platform suitable for delivering a wide range of materials (including small molecules, nanoparticles, siRNAs, and proteins) into living cells in a highly efficiently, massively parallel, arrayed fashion. There are three general steps involving to implement the procedure:1. The nanowires are fabricated by either growing them from a precursor material on the surface of a patterned substrate, or by etching the structures out of a substrate material from the top down.2. The surface of the nanowires is then chemically treated to facilitate their electrostatic linkage to the compound of interest. (Covalent linkage strategies may also be employed.)3. The compound of interest is then tethered to the nanowire by pipetting a few uLs of a solution containing the compound atop the nanowires. Microarraying techniques may also be used for the multiplex deposition of an assortment of molecular species. Once the solvent evaporates, the nanowire wafer may be used immediately or stored until needed.4. Cells are then plated on the nanowire surface. As they settle, they are impaled by the wires (typically within an hour) and the electrostatically linked agent detaches from the wires and is thus released into the cell cytosol. This single platform has been shown to be able to deliver small molecules, nanoparticles, RNAs, peptides, and proteins, into a number of primary and clonal cell with an efficiency greater than 95%. It should be noted that the Park laboratory has been able to mass-produce the wires on six-inch silicon wafers using a technique that could easily be implemented by any semiconductor foundry. The high-throughput, low-cost production of these silicon wafer arrays using widely available semiconductor processing should enable the wide adoption and rapid commercialization of this technology."," Drug Delivery  |   Semiconductors  |   Biomaterials  |   Semiconductors  |   Biomaterials  |   Semiconductors","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3211","Mick Sawka, (617) 496-3830","Harvard University"

As current draw increases and operating voltage decreases, inductive noise threatens the robustness and limits the clock frequency of high-performance processors. Large current swings over small time scales cause large voltage swings in the power-delivery subsystem. A significant drop in supply voltage can cause timing margin violations by slowing down logic circuits. For reliable and correct operation of the processor, voltage emergencies - large voltage swings that violate noise margins - must be avoided. The traditional way to deal with inductive noise is to over-design the processor to tolerate worst-case fluctuations. Unfortunately, the gap between nominal and worst-case operating conditions in modern microprocessor designs is growing. Such conservative operating margins ensure robust operation of the system, but can severely degrade performance due to the lower operating frequencies.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:To reduce the gap between nominal and worst-case operating voltages, Harvard researchers have developed a “voltage emergency predictor” that identifies when emergencies are imminent and prevents their occurrence. A voltage emergency predictor anticipates voltage emergencies using “voltage emergency signatures” (the combination of control flow and microarchitectural events leadings up to them) and throttles machine execution to prevent them. By doing so, the predictor enables chip designers to maximize performance with more aggressive timing margins. The signature-based predictor outperforms previously proposed architecture-centric techniques that rely only on voltage sensors to detect imminent problems and then react to emergencies via throttling. The invention recognizes and tracks patterns of emergency-prone activity to proactively throttle execution well before an emergency can occur. High prediction accuracy is possible, which translates to performance enhancements by reducing otherwise conservative margins. Additionally, the voltage emergency predictor is trained during normal operation and does not require fine tuning based on specifics of the microarchitecture nor the power delivery subsystem, as is the case with reactive sensor-based schemes."," Software/Algorithms  |   Semiconductors","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3348","Sam Liss, (617) 495-4371","Harvard University"

This invention relates to these proteins and nucleic acids, cells expressing the same, and methods for identifying compounds that modulate TIKI1/2 activity for use in the treatment of osteoporosis, bone fractures or cellular proliferative disorders such as cancer. ||

The TIKI proteins antagonize Wnt signaling by acting as Wnt-specific proteases that cleaves the amino-terminus of Wnt proteins, thereby inactivating them. TIKI1 and 2 are transmembrane proteins, and act in both Wnt-producing cells and Wnt-responsive cells. TIKI proteins are unique among known Wnt antagonists in that they are enzymes that inactivate Wnt proteins, whereas all other known Wnt antagonists, e.g. DKK-1 and SOST, inhibit Wnt-binding to receptors via protein-protein interaction. ||

The inventors first identified the TIKI proteins in Xenopus and both Tiki1 and Tiki2 genes are found in human, rabbit and fish.  Rodents only have one Tiki gene, Tiki2. In mice experiments, TIKI2 protein is expressed in osteoblasts postnatally and the Tiki2 gene homozygous knock-out mice exhibit high bone mass, suggesting that TIKI2, like Sclerostin, DKK1, and SFRP1, may be an important negative regulator of bone homeostasis."," Therapeutics - Drugs","http://www.childrensinnovations.org/SearchDetails.aspx?id=1770","Caron, Connie, connie.caron@childrens.harvard.edu","Children's Hospital Boston"

Dr. Cantley is a world-renowned scientist for first cloning and identifying PI3 kinase.  Dr. Josephson is a leading expert in radiology at Massachusetts General Hospital.","Overactivity of the signal transduction molecule phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase (PI3K) has a significant role in the progression of cancer and inflammatory disease.  In fact, PI3K mutations have been increasingly identified in 50% of solid tumors and 30% of breast cancers.   With this link to cancer, PI3K is rapidly becoming a central target for anti-cancer therapy.  Wortmannin, a specific PI3K inhibitor has potent anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory activities but has been unsuitable for clinical applications due to its inherent toxicity and instability in cells.  To overcome these limitations, the world-renowned expert in PI3K, Dr. Lew Cantley and leading radiologist Dr. Lee Josephson have identified and synthesized novel PI3K inhibitors suitable for cancer treatment.  These leading scientists have developed Wortmannin conjugates for both drug delivery and classical medicinal chemistry.  The Wortmannin conjugates or pro-drugs can be delivered as targeted or slow release forms of Wortmannin that may inhibit PI3K in tissues more selectively than the parent Wortmannin.  These pro-drugs conjugated to specific antibodies and peptides achieve targeted delivery of Wortmannin resulting in localized concentrations of the drug and reducing systemic toxicity. This targeted approach affords the additional advantage of delivering both Wortmannin and other anti-proliferative or anti-inflammatory molecules to effect inhibition of PI3K and other molecular pathways.  The development of PI3K inhibitors is essential for the treatment of diseases in which inhibiting cellular proliferation or inflammation is beneficial."," Drug Delivery","https://research.bidmc.harvard.edu/TVO/tvotech.asp?Submit=List&ID=660","Christine, Jost","Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"
"4069","Licensable Technology","Wound healing driven by unique population of muscle-specific Tregs","Mathis, Diane J.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Researchers at Harvard have identified and isolated a unique population of FoxP3+ CD4+ Tregs from muscle which exhibit tissue-regenerative properties.  These cells, as well as agents that enhance their proliferation/differentiation, and products derived from the cells may be used to promote tissue regeneration and wound healing.  The cells/agents may be applied to muscle tissue or directly to a wound.  In addition, they may be administered to patients with degenerative muscle conditions such are muscular dystrophy to promote muscle regeneration, and to the elderly to enhance wound healing.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Wound healing is a fundamental biological process that must operate efficiently, lifelong, to ensure survival of the organism.  It proceeds in two major stages: 1) recruitment, activation and expansion of inflammatory cells at the wound sit; and 2) waning of the inflammation in concert with mobilization of tissue-repair processes.  Researchers at Harvard have identified a population of unique, tissue regenerative regulatory T-cells (Tregs) in muscle which play a critical role in regulating wound healing.  In addition to their tissue-regenerative properties, these Treg cells have a unique phenotype, distinct from that of previously described regulatory T-cell populations.  The numbers of these muscle-specific Tregs fluctuate in muscle diseases such as muscular dystrophy, and with aging.  These cells, as well as agents that modulate their differentiation, and agents produced by the cells can be used to promote wound healing and muscle regeneration.  •     Treg population expands at site of muscle injury.  Researchers in the labs identified a unique population of FoxP3+ CD4+ Tregs that infiltrate injured muscle as the inflammatory stage of wound healing transitions to the regenerative stage.  •     Ablating Tregs inhibits muscle regeneration. In the absence of Tregs, the initial inflammation following muscle injury is not resolved, and muscle regeneration is impaired, indicating that these Tregs are required for efficient muscle repair.•     Muscle-specific Tregs are a unique population.  A comparative gene-expression analysis of Tregs from spleen and from injured skeletal muscle shows that more than 500 genes are differentially expressed between these two populations. The researchers identified a constellation of gene transcripts which, as an ensemble, represent a muscle-Treg-specific gene expression signature.•     Muscle-specific Tregs are enriched in muscular dystrophy.  In addition to increasing following acute muscle injury, the researchers showed that muscle-specific Tregs are enriched in murine models of the degenerative muscle condition, muscular dystrophy.•     Muscle-specific Tregs are decreased in aged mice.  The regenerative capacity of muscle is known to decrease with age.  Accordingly, following muscle injury in aged mice, the researchers found a reduced population of muscle-specific Tregs.Ongoing experiments are underway to look at the effects of several Treg-augmenting reagents on treating acute wound healing, muscular dystrophy and wound healing in aged animals."," Therapeutics - Drugs","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=4069","Michal Preminger, (617) 432-0920","Harvard University"

Their small size, fecund reproduction, rapid external development, and transparency of the embryo (and in certain strains the adult, see CMCC 1584) allow whole organism screening with a vertebrate animal. With the development of liquid handling protocols for automated whole animal transfer, and automated screening for cellular, tissue and whole organism endpoints, zebrafish represent the only truly high throughput, whole animal chemical screening platform.

Demand for large scale production of embryos, closely synchronized in their time of fertilization, is poorly met by current technologies. The current standard in the art involves multiple (stressful) transfers of breeding fish, large numbers of breeding tanks occupying a large footprint of expensive facility space, and time-consuming manipulations by technicians. In addition, poor attention to the natural ecology of zebrafish spawning results in inconsistent and suboptimal embryo production.

Children's Hospital's Aquatic Resources Program has paid close attention to optimizing zebrafish husbandry (see for instance Sessa, et al. 2008) and has developed extensive know-how in optimization of zebrafish production facilities. One result is an innovative apparatus for mass spawning for zebrafish embryo production. With attention to water depth preferences, male-female interaction before and during spawning, and natural timing, this technology allows highly synchronized mass production of zebrafish embryos.

"3066","Licensable Technology","Zero knowledge proofs in large stock trades","Rabin, Michael O.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Auctions and electronic marketplaces have been used to facilitate trillions of dollars in trade in the world economy. However, fraud is a big issue that can plague electronic auctions. Different fraud possibilities include an auctioneer deviating from the rules of an auction, an auctioneer “leaking” useful information about bids received during the bidding process, refusal of the auctioneer to accept bids into the auction and refusal by bidders to reveal bids after the bid submission deadline. Most past solutions on the use of cryptography for conducting secure auctions use multiple auctioneers or require shared computation among bidders. Thus the current state-of-the art for secure auctions is still not very scalable, nor is it practical in a business setting. Harvard’s secure online auction technology can be valuable and cost-effective for conducting secure sealed-bid auctions in any commercial setting. In addition to secure online auctions, the technology can be useful for foreign securities exchanges, auctions of financial instruments, sealed-bid quotations for large contracts, in procurement departments, in construction, government, or defense contract bid processes.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:The invention is a practical software protocol for conducting sealed-bid auctions. The auctioneer must accept all bids submitted and follow the published rules of the auction. The bids are maintained secret from the auctioneer and all bidders until the auction closes and no bidder is able to change or repudiate her bid. After the auction, the auctioneer opens the bids but can still announce an outcome and prove it correct without revealing any bid. In addition to a seller, multiple bidders, and an auctioneer, our model uses witnesses to ensure the security of the auction. The witnesses protect both the bidder and the auctioneer against fraud and manipulation. Harvard’s novel technology guarantees bidders that the auction is fair. Our system reduces fraud and encourages honest bidding and competitive behavior among bidders. Insiders are unable to tip off outsiders about values and bidders receive proof that their bid was/was not the lowest. Our technology is scalable, accommodating tens of thousands of bidders in at most a day of computation on a 64-node network. By involving a single auctioneer, our model is also more realistic from a business perspective."," Software/Algorithms","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=3066","Alan Gordon, (617) 384-5000","Harvard University"
"4086","Licensable Technology","Zinc-finger nucleases: determining and improving target sequence specificity","Liu, David R.","MARKETS ADDRESSED:Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) are enzymes engineered to recognize and cleave desired target DNA sequences. A ZFN monomer consists of a zinc-finger DNA-binding domain fused with a nonspecific FokI restriction endonuclease cleavage domain. As the FokI nuclease domain must dimerize to cleave DNA, ZFNs are designed in pairs to recognize two unique sequences flanking a spacer sequence of variable length and to cleave only when bound as a dimer. In addition to providing powerful research tools, ZFNs are in development as therapeutic gene therapy agents. Since imperfect specificity of engineered zinc-fingers domains has been linked to cellular toxicity, methods for determining and improving the specificities of ZFNs should be of considerable interest to companies developing therapeutic ZFNs.INNOVATIONS & ADVANTAGES:Researchers in the laboratory of Professor David Liu have developed an in vitro selection method to broadly examine the DNA cleavage specificity of active ZFNs. The method revealed hundreds of thousands of DNA sequences, some present in the human genome, that can be cleaved in vitro by two ZFNs: CCR5-224 and VF2468, which target the endogenous human CCR5 and VEGFA genes, respectively. These results were further validated in cultured human cells. The finding have implications for the design, testing, and application of candidate therapeutic ZFNs with increased specificity, and in particular suggest that ZFN specificity can be enhanced by designing ZFNs with decreased binding affinity, by lowering ZFN expression and by choosing target sites that differ by at least three base pairs from their closest sequence relatives in the genome.In vitro selection for ZFN-mediated cleavage: Preselection library members are concatemers (represented by arrows) of identical ZFN target sites lacking 5' phosphates (P). L, left half-site; R, right half-site, S, spacer; and L', S' and R' are sequences complementary to L, S and R, respectively. ZFN cleavage reveals a 5' phosphate, which is required for ligation of sequencing adapters (red and blue). The only sequences that can be amplified by PCR using primers complementary to the red and blue adapters are sequences that have been cleaved twice and have adapters on both ends. DNA cleaved at adjacent sites is purified via gel electrophoresis and sequenced. A computational screening step after sequencing ensures that the filled-in spacer sequences (S and S') are complementary and therefore from the same molecule."," Genomics/Proteomics  |   Drug Discovery Tools  |   Genomics/Proteomics  |   Research Tools","http://otd.harvard.edu/technologies/tech.php?case=4086","Vivian Berlin, (617) 496-0474","Harvard University"
